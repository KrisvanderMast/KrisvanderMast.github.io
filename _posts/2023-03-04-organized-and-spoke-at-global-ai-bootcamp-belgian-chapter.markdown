Today I organized and spoke at [the Belgian chapter of the Global AI bootcamp][1]. The event was held at [Spoor 18][2] offices in Mechelen. We had 4 interesting sessionss. The sessions were:

1. How Proximus utilizes AI for improving the well-being in cities by [Xavier Geerinck][3]
2. Machine Learning on auto-pilot: Automated Machine Learning" by [Nico Jacobs][4]
3. Introduction to the Python programming language by [Kris van der Mast][5]
4. Introduction to GPT by [Sammy Deprez][6]

The sessions were well received and we had an audience from all over Belgium. As Mechelen is a central location in Belgium, it was easy to reach for everyone. We had a good mix of people from the industry and students.  

Pizza and drinks were provided by [Arinti][8] and [azug][7].
