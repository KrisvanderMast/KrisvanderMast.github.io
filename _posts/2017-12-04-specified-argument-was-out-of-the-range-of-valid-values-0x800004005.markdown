A couple of weeks ago I was going through my preparations and demos about the Microsoft Bot Framework to [talk at SharePoint Saturday in Lisbon][1]. As I didn't use Visual Studio lately on this machine but mostly [Visual Studio Code][2] for some of [my recent talks][3] I was rather surprised to see the following error:  

![Specified argument was out of the range of valid values 0x800004005][4]  

Ouch! No fun to discover that several days before going to go to a conference. After some digging around it turned out to be I wasn't the only one. The culprit apparently was the recent Fall Creator update of Windows 10. The remedy? Uninstall IIS Express and install it again. After that it worked again for me. The steps I took to solve it were:  

1. Open the __Control Panel__ of Windows 10
2. Go to __Add and Remove Programs__
3. Search for __IIS Express__ and remove it
4. Start up the Visual Studio 2017 installer
5. Go to the __Individual Components__ tab
6. Check __IIS Express__ and click the __Modify__ button

The full exception I got:
