Since around 2006 I've been using [dasBlog][1] as my main engine to keep my posts up and running. Since then a lot has changed in the world and I noticed that it was running on its last legs. Over the years I also switched from providers and things went awry concerning configuration and I had to jump around to keep things working. Luckily [Windows Live Writer][2] helped out to overcome these things but still.  

A good while ago I already went through the investigation of which replacement I should go for: Ghost, Wordpress, Orchard, Blogengine.NET or one of its follow ups. I heard good and bad things of all and still was hesitant to go for either one of them even though I know a good many people who've opted for one of these choices and are very happy with their choice. [Jekyll][3] and other static file generating site _engines_ came on my radar and when I noticed my good friend [Maarten Balliauw][4] moved our [azug][5] and [CloudBrew][6] sites to [Jekyll][3] and his own blog I investigated a bit more. Well, as you can guess I ended up starting to use it myself as well in an attempt to renew my efforts in writing blog posts (I noticed due to all the difficulties I had with keeping things running I was less tempted to start writing in the first place).  

So yes [www.krisvandermast.com][7] has moved mostly to [Jekyll][3] and after starting with it I'm going to try to convert my old blog to the new format and have a redirect mechanism in place so that all references stay in place. I've put over the years, starting in 2002, quite some links to images/blog posts on the [ASP.NET forums][8] site and don't want people to stumble on 404 messages. So for now my old [dasBlog][1] engine will keep on running until I get all sorted out.
