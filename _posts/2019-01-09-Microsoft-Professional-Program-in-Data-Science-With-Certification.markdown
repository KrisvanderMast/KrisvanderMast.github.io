Besides my usual day to day work including Azure, C#, ASP.NET Core, (chat)bots, Cognitive Services, ... I'm currently becoming more and more interested in Data Science and AI.  

I'm exploring a several courses to see if they would fit me (and the misses as she also wants to get her hands dirty on the subject).  

I recently found a course with certification which I plan to attend in the coming months starting February: [Microsoft Professional Program in Data Science](https://www.edx.org/microsoft-professional-program-data-science). If you already took this course be sure to leave your comment on how you perceived it.  

I'm also going to follow the next [Belgian PowerBI days](https://www.powerbidays.com/) in Mechelen in a couple of weeks. Looking forward to it.

Kris.
