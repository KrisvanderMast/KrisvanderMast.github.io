A long awaited arrival of Visual Studio 2010 came true today as Microsoft shipped the product. This is one version that I installed also during the alpha and beta periods to test out and provide feedback towards Microsoft about things that could be made better or bugs. I’m looking forward into using it as soon as possible at work as well.
