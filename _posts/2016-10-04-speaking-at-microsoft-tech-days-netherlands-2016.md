It’s not the first time I speak in the Netherlands but I was happy to get asked again by the organizational team to come back this year. Unlike the year before when it was in The Hague, this year the venue was in the larger RAI building in Amsterdam. A lot of attendees showed up. From what I heard from the people at Microsoft Netherlands it was a record amount and they didn’t expect that many people showing up in the first place.

The session itself about Azure Web Jobs, same like what I gave the day before in Poland, went great and I had quite some attendees.

In the evening there was a cozy speaker dinner with climbing wall at [XPirit](/images/xpirit.com).

Grz, Kris.
