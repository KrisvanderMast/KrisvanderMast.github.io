One of my personal favorite channels, besides those on tv of course, is Channel 9: a dedicated media platform that developers that work with Microsoft technology just must have in their favorites.

This morning I noticed, probably because MIX is busy (/images/www.snowball.be) is [currenlty following all those interesting sessions](/images/Leaving+For+Las+Vegas.aspx)), that there's a lot of new material covering Silverlight:

* [Scott Guthrie: Silverlight and the Cross-Platform CLR](/images/showpost.aspx?postid=304508)* [Silverlight Event Handling with JavaScript](/images/Showpost.aspx?postid=304506)* [Using AJAX to Dynamically Update Silverlight Content](/images/Showpost.aspx?postid=304530)* [Using Silverlight Brushes for Color, Gradient and Video](/images/Showpost.aspx?postid=304490)* [Animating Raster Art for Silverlight with Expression Blend](/images/Showpost.aspx?postid=304513)* [Adding Ink Support to a Silverlight-based Application](/images/Showpost.aspx?postid=304497)* [Delivering Parameterized Silverlight Content with ASP.NET](/images/Showpost.aspx?postid=304524)* [Publishing Media Content to Silverlight Streaming Services](/images/Showpost.aspx?postid=304610)* [Using Expression Blend to Control Silverlight Media Playback](/images/Showpost.aspx?postid=304514)* ...

Grz, Kris.
