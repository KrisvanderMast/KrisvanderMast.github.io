Today I took the plane to Frankfurt, Germany to talk at Basta spring 2018 about __[Serverless on Azure][4]__.  

Basically the talk was about the big 3: [Azure Functions][1], [Azure Logic Apps][2] and [Azure Event Grid][3].

Usually I give quite some demos during a presentation but as it was on the architects day of Basta I decided to show demos but mostly explained by slides, drawing on Surface book ad hoc and talking about my experiences with Serverless on Azure. The audience was listening attentively and I was able to get them to laugh from time to time :bowtie:.  

After an hour of talk and demos I got some people over to ask some questions and I provided answers. After that I checked in at the hotel for the coming night and later on went with Gill Cleeren, another Belgian MVP, into the city to explore it a bit.

As usual Basta was organized in a great way, good sessions, good food, friendly people who are interested in what you have to say. I like the conference.
