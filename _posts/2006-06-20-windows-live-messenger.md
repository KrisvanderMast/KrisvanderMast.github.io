After months of using the Beta variant of this new incarnation of messenger, and with a rechristianed name that makes it a part of the whole new Live productline, I got my hands on the final bits. Since I installed IE7 Beta 2 I also put <http://search.live.com/> as my personal home page. I really dig the AJAXised scrollable overview of the found resources. If you haven't checked it out yet, you really should!

If you want your copy just browse to <http://get.live.com/messenger/overview>.

Grz, Kris.
