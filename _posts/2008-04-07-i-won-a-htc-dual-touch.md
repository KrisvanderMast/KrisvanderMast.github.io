I got the message that I won a HTC Dual Touch thanks to a contest of one of the sponsors (/images/www.ausy.be)) on **[last Visug event](/images/VisugSeminarJuwalLowyWCFBeyondTheEndpoints.aspx)**. It's a nice phone with a bright screen. The only thing that's lacking is wifi. Too bad because I would've really loved that feature.

Grz, Kris.
