Hi,

after been asked multiple times by peers and reading a lot of blogs myself, I also decided to start blogging. Since the urge to start blogging is mainly driven from the idea to share technical information, you can expect to see mainly technical content on this blog. 
That's also the reason why I chose to have the Hello, World! as subject for my first blog post. **Hello, world!** is quite commonly used in the world of programming and if you like to know more about it I would suggest that you [take a look at this article on wikipedia](/images/Hello%2C_world%21).

So, who am I? 
Well, I'm best known online for my efforts on the [ASP.NET forums](/images/forums.asp.net) where I'm a dedicated moderator and top 10 contributor nicknamed [**XIII**](/images/XIII.aspx). 
If you want to learn more about me you can check out the [About page](/images/about.aspx).

Well, that's it for now...

Grz, Kris.
