Yesterday evening [VISUG](/images/ "VISUG"), a .NET related Belgian user group in which I participate, organised a geek dinner in [Antwerp](/images/Antwerp "Antwerp"). 12 participants showed up and we had a blast. Talking about work, tech stuff, .NET (/images/of course), comics, movies, ... There were some people I haven't met before so it was also great to socialize with those as well. The food, spare ribs à volonté, was also delicious and if you visit Antwerp on an occasion I can recommend the Amadeus restaurant.

Grz, Kris.
