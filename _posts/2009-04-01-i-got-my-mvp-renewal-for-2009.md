Got the mail today with the great news that I’m renewed as an MVP for the year 2009. I must say, a week after hearing that I became an [ASP Insider](/images/IrsquoveBecomeAnASPInsider.aspx) this is also very good news. I also got the news that my colleague [Marc Gregoire](/images/blog), one of the 3 colleagues I went to the MVP summit with, also got renewed. So also my congratulations go to him.

Grz, Kris.
