Finally the cat's out of the bag: [Service Pack 1 for Windows Vista has been released](/images/windows-vista-sp1-released-to-windows-update.aspx). MSDN subscribers could already download and install it. I tried a couple of weeks ago on my Macbook Pro (/images/on which I run Windows Vista Ultimate thanks to bootcamp) and it worked out nicely for me. 
 
Grz, Kris.
