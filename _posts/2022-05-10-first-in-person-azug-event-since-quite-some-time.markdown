This felt so great!  

After a long time of only virtual events, we finally had our first in person event again. Admit that after some time of only seeing people on a screen, and getting somewhat fed up with it as we spend nowadays so much time in Teams/Zoom/... calls, it was great seeing people again in real life.  

We had the pleasure to find a host in [Dataroots](https://dataroots.io/), a company located in Leuven, Belgium. We were welcomed by a food truck which offered tasty hamburgers. I also met up with [CÃ©dric Verstraeten](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cedricverstraeten/) for the first time in real life.  

Hopefully many more events to come! It felt so great to be back in the community again.
