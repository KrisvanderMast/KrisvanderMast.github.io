I just opened the [Preview portal](/images/ "Windows Azure portal") and was welcomed by a small guidance wizard with a quick tour. After that I noticed that there were some new icons and that the +NEW menu got an upgrade as well.

So in the main menu there’s a new add-ons item:

[![portal_addons](/images/portal_addons_thumb.png "portal_addons")](/images/portal_addons.png)

And in the +NEW button on the lower left there’s also the new feature “Store”:

[![portal_new](/images/portal_new_thumb.png "portal_new")](/images/portal_new.png)

However when clicking it I got the message:

[![portal_addon_message](/images/portal_addon_message_thumb.png "portal_addon_message")](/images/portal_addon_message.png)

That’s a bit of a bummer so I guess I’ll have to wait before I can make use off the new things being provided here. I have a good feeling that next week Microsoft will reveal a lot more about this during the BUILD conference.

Grz, Kris.
