It’s great to see that an awesome platform like [Windows Azure](/images/ "Windows Azure") is gaining more and more traction along the way. Recently it was announced that Oracle is partnering with Microsoft. This enables users to run Oracle software on [Windows Azure](/images/ "Windows Azure") with the following benefits:

* Effective immediately, customers can run supported Oracle software on Windows Server Hyper-V and in Windows Azure.
* Effective immediately, Oracle provides license mobility for customers who want to run Oracle software on Windows Azure.
* Windows Azure images with popular configurations of Oracle software including Java, Oracle Database, Oracle WebLogic Server, and Oracle Linux are now available in preview in the Windows Azure image gallery.
* Microsoft now offers fully licensed and supported Java in Windows Azure.

Especially the last sentence will be of interest to my friends and colleagues in the Java space.
