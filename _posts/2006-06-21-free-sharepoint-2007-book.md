Hi,

I found out, via [Jan Tielens' blog](/images/free-sharepoint-2007-e-book.aspx), whom found out via [Eli Robillard's blog](/images/Free-SharePoint-2007-Book.aspx), that you can download a 236 pages free eBook in pdf format about **7 Development Projects with the 2007 Microsoft Office System and Windows SharePoint Services 2007**.

So for all you guys and girls interested: [get your copy here](/images/7%20Development%20Projects%20with%20the%202007%20Microsoft%20Office%20System%20and%20Windows%20SharePoint%20Services%202007.pdf).

Grz, Kris.
