I guess I'm one of those people who like to experiment with new tools. For my feedreading I used google feedreader, RSS bandit, omea reader and yesterday evening I found out about this new feedreader called [Greatnews](/images/www.curiostudio.com). I didn't have a lot of time to experiment with it but it looks promissing. It supports labelling, of which I'm a fan, and it also stores the downloaded content on the hard drive so you can reread it even when you're offline.

If you want to learn more about you can [take a look at the feature list](/images/feature.html).

Grz, Kris.
