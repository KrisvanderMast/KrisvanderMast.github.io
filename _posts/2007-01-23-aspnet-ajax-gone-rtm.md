Woohoo!!

I just found out that the RTM bits are available for download:

[ASP.NET AJAX Extensions](/images/details.aspx?FamilyID=ca9d90fa-e8c9-42e3-aa19-08e2c027f5d6&DisplayLang=en "ASP.NET AJAX") 
[ASP.NET AJAX Futures CTP January](/images/details.aspx?FamilyID=4cb52ea3-9548-4064-8137-09b96af97617&displaylang=en "ASP.NET AJAX Futures CTP January") 
[ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit](/images/ProjectReleases.aspx?ProjectName=AtlasControlToolkit "ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit")

Update: Scott Guthrie also wrote a, more lengthy, [article about it on his blog](/images/asp-net-ajax-1-0-released.aspx). Apparently they're also releasing the source code of the Extensions (/images/UpdatePanel, UpdateProgress, ...). Personally I think this is great news and could help in the adoption of this AJAX framework.

Grz, Kris.
