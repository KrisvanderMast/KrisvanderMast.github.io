This week the long awaited [Silverlight 4 tools for Visual Studio 2010 got released](/images/details.aspx?FamilyID=902a7539-c4b5-4e54-b4c9-1432daabe1e8&displaylang=en "Silverlight 4 tools for Visual Studio 2010"). With it ships version 1 of WCF RIA Services.

Of course new technology needs some guidance and there’s a great [training kit made available](/images/ "Silverlight 4 Training kit").

If you like to read books then I suggest you take a look at [Microsoft Silverlight 4 Data and Services Cookbook](/images/book), of which I’m a reviewer, and the book I’m currently reading: [Microsoft Silverlight 4 Business Application Development: Beginner’s Guide](/images/book).

Grz, Kris.
