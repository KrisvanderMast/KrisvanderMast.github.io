Yesterday I went talking about my experiences with chatbots I gained during the last years working at clients and in a second part of the talk how to create a simple chatbot with [Microsoft Bot Builder version 4](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) technology. Topics I covered in that second part were things like suggested cards to make quick replies, how to make use of the Bot emulator (version 4), how to capture interactive sessions, state management, waterfallstep dialogs and to end it all [Adaptive cards](https://adaptivecards.io/). The audience liked it and I got some great feedback, also from other seasoned speakers that were attending my session.  

Today was something different though.
