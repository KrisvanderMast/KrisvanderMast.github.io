Yep, you read that right: Windows Live Writer is out of beta. I've been using it for quite a while, since the betas, and found it a decent blog writer. One thing though was that it was a bit tough to include source code. Luckily it's possible to create plugins. One of those plugins is created by one of my [VISUG](/images/www.visug.be) collegues Christoph to insert, you guessed correctly, source code. You can [download SyntaxColor4Writer here](/images/index.php?title=SyntaxColor4Writer).

Grz, Kris.
