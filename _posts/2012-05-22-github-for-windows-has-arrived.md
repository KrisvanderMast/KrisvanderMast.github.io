Seems it paid off to let [Phil Haack move to GitHub](/images/last-day-at-microsoft.aspx). I just noticed that there’s a version 1.0 for download of [GitHub for Windows](/images/1127-github-for-windows "GitHub for Windows"). I quickly installed it and opened up the ASP.NET web stack:

[![githubforwindows](/images/githubforwindows_thumb.png "githubforwindows")](/images/githubforwindows_2.png)

Sweet!

I like the way it looks, somewhat like Metro(/images/twit).

Grz, Kris.
