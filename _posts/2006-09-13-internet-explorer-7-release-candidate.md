I installed the latest bits of the Release Candidate recently and really like it. Another great thing to find out is that javascript seems to be much faster now. This will especially be a great boost since javascript's becoming more and more important with the AJAX whirlwind. Also [Microsoft AJAX](/images/AtlasRenamed.aspx) will greatly benefit from this improvement.

I got the news from Ajaxian, [here](/images/dramatically-improved-ie7-javascript-performance) and [here](/images/improved-javascript-performance-in-ie7).

Grz, Kris.
