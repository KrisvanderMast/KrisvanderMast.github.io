Last Thursday I was invited to come to the free local _conference_ uNite at [Ordina](http://www.ordina.be). It was an interesting agenda (see below) and because [I used to work there for 4.5 years](https://www.linkedin.com/in/krisvandermast/) it was also a nice opportunity to meet up with former colleagues.  

I enjoyed the talks by Jan Tielens from Microsoft and the ones about Serverless computing and CQRS. I couldn't attend the final slot of the day unfortunately but had a great afternoon and met up with a bunch of people that I used to work with which I always find a nice social interaction to do.

### The agenda of the day

I'm looking forward to another edition.
