Since more and more people are using ajax and as such javascript/ecmascript, you as a developer/designer need tools to make it through the day. Here are some that I like to use:

* [jsmin](/images/jsmin.html "jsmin"): compresses javascript
* [YUICompressor](/images/ "YUICompressor"): compresses javascript. I’ve also written an article on how to integrate it in Visual Studio: [Compressing and obfuscating javascript and css files with YUICompressor in Visual Studio](/images/CompressingAndObfuscatingJavascriptAndCssFilesWithYUICompressorInVisualStudio.aspx)
* [jsbeautyfier](/images/ "jsbeautifier"): “uncompresses” javascript (/images/handy when you have a minified version of a script and want it to become more readable)
* [jslint](/images/ "jslint"): The javascript Code Quality Tool

Grz, Kris.
