A lot of people, myself included, like to see the line numbers on each line while coding. I find it easer to remember where my code is but also to use the ctrl + g (/images/goto line number) shortcut. By default this feature is disabled but luckely it's quite easy to turn it on.

Just navigate to the menu, choose Tools | Options and this expand the Text editor node in the treeview on the left like shown in Figure 1:

[![](/images/linenumbersvsnet2005small.png)](/images/linenumbersvsnet2005.png "Showing line numbers in vs.net") 
**Figure 1**: The expanded Text Editor part

There you can choose the All languages node or the node of the language that you're interested in and check the Line numbers checkbox. Click the OK button and you have the line numbers appearing in your source view.

Grz, Kris.
