Thanks to my MVP status I got a free MSDN subscription that's packed with Visual Studio 2005 Team Suite. The installation however still lacked the Database Professional part. After some msn-ing with [Gabriël](/images/blog) I could also download the extra addon for that as well.

You can find the download here: [Visual Studio 2005 Team Edition for Database Professionals Add-on for Visual Studio 2005 Team Suite Edition](/images/details.aspx?FamilyID=7de00386-893d-4142-a778-992b69d482ad&DisplayLang=en).

Grz, Kris.
