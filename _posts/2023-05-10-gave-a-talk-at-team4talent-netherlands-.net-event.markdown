I just finished my talk at the Team4Talent Netherlands .NET event. I gave me popular session _The stuff you don't want to write: Documentation_. The session was well received and I got some good questions. During the session I also got some good feedback from the audience which was very nice. After the sessions we concluded the evening with some drinks and snacks and I had some good conversations with the attendees.  

The setting was in a [small cinema room inside the Ingenhousz hotel][1]. 

I want to thank Team4Talent for inviting me and I hope to see you again soon.
