Last week I had to help someone out on the ASP.NET that was asking the question that he couldn't find the 2.0 bits anymore of the [ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit](/images/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=16488). Indeed, when you navigate to the Releases tab of the project on Codeplex you'll only see this list:

![Source Code](/images/SourceCode.gif) AjaxControlToolkit-Framework3.5SP1.zip

source code, 3033K, uploaded Aug 21 - 24104 downloads

![Application](/images/RuntimeBinary.gif) AjaxControlToolkit-Framework3.5SP1-NoSource.zip

application, 1716K, uploaded Aug 21 - 8256 downloads

![Application](/images/RuntimeBinary.gif) AjaxControlToolkit-Framework3.5SP1-DllOnly.zip

application, 512K, uploaded Aug 22 - 5704 downloads

![Application](/images/RuntimeBinary.gif) AjaxControlToolkit-ScriptFilesOnly.zip

application, 238K, uploaded Aug 22 - 2555 downloads

Phew, no more 2.0 bits. It seems that Microsoft decided to cut on keeping things rolling since SP1 of .NET 3.5 came out.

Luckily for the person I helped out you can still reach to the 2.0 bits by [navigating to this url (/images/the release of February 29th 2008)](/images/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=11121).

Grz, Kris.
