Recently Microsoft showed us something new to the world which I think is very interesting: **Azure App Service**.

[![appservicesuite](/images/appservicesuite_3.png "appservicesuite")](/images/ "What is Azure App Service")

This new offering makes it a snap to create, deploy, manage your applications and APIs and integrate third party APIs as well.

First of all the two parts that stayed the same but got a rebranding:

* [Web apps](/images/ "Web apps") == Web Sites
* [Mobile apps](/images/ "Mobile apps") == Mobile Services

Two newcomers in the arena are

* [Logic apps](/images/ "Logic apps") to automate access and use of data
* [API apps](/images/ "API apps") to easily build and consume Cloud APIs

There are several great videos available that show you a quick introduction:

* [Announcement by Scott Guthrie and Bill Staples](/images/azure-march-announcement)
* [Web Apps](/images/Azure-App-Service-Web-Apps-with-Yochay-Kiriaty)
* [Mobile Apps](/images/Azure-App-Service-Mobile-Apps-with-Kirill-Gavrylyuk)
* [Logic Apps](/images/Azure-App-Service-Logic-Apps-with-Josh-Twist)
* [API Apps](/images/Azure-App-Service-API-Apps-with-Scott-Hunter)

Grz, Kris.
