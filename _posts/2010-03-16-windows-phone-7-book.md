Only yesterday I was viewing the [MIX10 keynote](/images/ "MIX10") at [Microsoft Brussels](/images/default.aspx "Microsoft Belux") via live stream and today I noticed on twitter that Charles Petzold has already put a preview content online of his upcoming book about the topic. [Take a look here for a pdf or xps excerpt](/images/index.html "Charles Petzold free book Windows Phone 7").

Grz, Kris.
