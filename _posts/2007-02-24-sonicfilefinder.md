Wow, the news just keeps coming today. I found out about this little tool [SonicFileFinder](/images/index.htm "SonicFileFinder").

*SonicFileFinder is a free add-in for Visual Studio 2005 that allows a fast and convenient search for any file within every Project of the loaded Solution by entering the complete filename or just a part of it. The found file(/images/s) can either be edited with a single keystroke or a Windows Explorer / CommandLine prompt can be opened at the file's location.*

Grz, Kris.
