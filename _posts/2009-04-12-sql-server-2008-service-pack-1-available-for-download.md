Taken from the download site:

*SQL Server 2008 Service Pack 1 (/images/SP1) is now available. You can use these packages to upgrade any SQL Server 2008 edition. 
**Note:**We remain committed to our plans to keep service packs contained, focusing on essential updates only, primarily a Roll-up of Cumulative Update 1 to 3, Quick Fix Engineering (/images/QFE) updates, as well as fixes to issues reported through the SQL Server community. While keeping product changes contained, we have made significant investments to ease deployment and management of Service Packs:*

* *Slipstream – You are now able to integrate the base installation with service packs (/images/or Hotfixes) and install in a single step.*
* *Service Pack Uninstall – You are now able to uninstall only the Service Pack (/images/without removing the whole instance)*
* *Report Builder 2.0 Click Once capability*

Download it [here](/images/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=66ab3dbb-bf3e-4f46-9559-ccc6a4f9dc19).

Grz, Kris.
