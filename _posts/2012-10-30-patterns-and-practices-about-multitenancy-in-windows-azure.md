The following document in the Microsoft Patterns & Practices about Windows Azure deals with multitenancy. It ships with a book explaining several important things like:

* The Tailspin scenario
* Hosting a multi-tenant application on Windows Azure
* Choosing a multi-tenant data architecture
* Partitioning multi-tenant applications
* Maximizing availability, scalability and elasticity
* Securing multi-tenant applications
* Managing and monitoring multi-tenant applications

Best of all, it also comes with sample code.
