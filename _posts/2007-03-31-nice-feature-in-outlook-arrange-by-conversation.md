Sometimes you just find out new stuff by accident. This one also falls in that category. Because I'm moderator on the ASP.NET forums I also get quite some email from that site. Especially when I want to track a certain thread that also interests me. In the past I just got all emails ordered by date but apparently you can also group them by conversation which is awesome since I really like that feature about GMail.

Grz, Kris.
