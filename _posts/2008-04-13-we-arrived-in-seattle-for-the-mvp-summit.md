This morning I got up quite early to check my baggage a last time and drive to the rail station. There I met up with 2 other Belgian MVP's: Gill & Ilse. Once arrived at Schiphol, Gill and I got some bad news: our flight was completely overbooked so we had to sit down for quite some time while all the other people were already boarding the plane. Only in the last couple of minutes before the plane would take off our names were called for and we hurried to the plane (/images/and through security). Then our long journey of about 10 hours could begin. We were actually very relieved that we could make it while we had to leave others behind in Belgium (/images/Joris Poelmans didn't make it unfortunately). This was my first flight outside of Europe but the comfort on the plane itself was good: decent meals and several movies to see in the little screen in front of you (/images/watched I am legend, The golden compass and National treasure 2). After arriving we checked in at the Sheraton hotel and afterwards went for the registration. After that, and some siteseeing/shopping in Seattle, we went to eat something in the Cheesecake factory: and delicious and giant hamburger. At first sight Seattle seems like a small city but I'm sure we didn't cover the whole city area yet :-).

And afterwards a burger (/images/double pun fun hamburger) at the cheesecake factory (/images/aka real American food). By the way it looked much better, and tasted way much better.

We actually couldn't finish it so we have to go out for desert, a delicious cheese cake, on a later date this week.

I also got to know already several MVP's from Tsuchiya, Chili, Denmark, Switzerland and I also had the pleasure to meet up with a Japanese MVP.

Grz, Kris.
