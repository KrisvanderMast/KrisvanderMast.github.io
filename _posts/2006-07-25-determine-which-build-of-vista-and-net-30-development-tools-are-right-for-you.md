Just found this on Tom Archer's blog. At the moment it can be quite confusing to keep up with all the CTP's, releases and which month's version should I use? Well, this blog entry tries to make it clearer: [Determining Which Build of Windows Vista and .NET 3.0 Development Tools is Right for You](/images/668572.aspx).

Grz, Kris.
