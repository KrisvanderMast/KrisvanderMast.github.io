On June 26th, [community day 2008](/images/www.communityday.be) was held in Keerbergen. Last year I couldn't make it so I really wanted to go this year. It was all thanks to the sponsors that this event could be held in the first place and it was fun to see so many familiar faces. Old colleagues, other MVPs, ... 
 
I followed these 3 presentations: Entity Framework, new things in SQL Server 2008 and 10 greatest new additions to SQL Server 2008. During the first session I even won a book (/images/Programming Microsoft LINQ) given by one of the sponsors of the event. Tip: it pays off to be a Star Wars fan when you get a question. 
 
After all the sessions we still had some time to enjoy a dinner in company of our peers. Of course a lot was talked about community day, technology, ... during that time. 
 
Grz, Kris.
