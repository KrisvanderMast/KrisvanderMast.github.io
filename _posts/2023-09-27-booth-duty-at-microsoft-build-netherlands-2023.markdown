Just came back from Utrecht Netherlands where I helped out at the [Global AI][1] booth at [Microsoft Build Netherlands 2023][2]. It was a great experience to talk to people about AI and how it can help them in their daily lives. I also got to meet some of the other Global AI ambassadors and it was great to see how they are helping to spread the word about AI.  

Not only that but I also got into the contact with the ladies of _[Dutch women in tech][3]_. When I heard about what they're trying to accomplish I immediately wanted to help them out and got them into contact with the Belgian group _[Clusity][4]_. Hopefully something nice will come out of that.  

Of course we had a lot of fun too. Here's a picture of me and my fellow community members:
