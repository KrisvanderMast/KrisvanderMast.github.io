It's great to see that one of [your own workarounds](/images/GithubAndVisualStudioAndTwoFactorAuthentication.aspx) is getting obsolete. This morning I checked social media and noticed that Github put a new extension on the market that integrates nicely with Visual Studio 2015.

Be sure to check it out at <https://aka.ms/ghfvs>. Also be sure to check out the following post [GitHub Inside Your Visual Studio](/images/github-in-your-visual-studio) and video: [video I recorded for Microsoft's Channel 9 site](/images/217)

Grz, Kris
