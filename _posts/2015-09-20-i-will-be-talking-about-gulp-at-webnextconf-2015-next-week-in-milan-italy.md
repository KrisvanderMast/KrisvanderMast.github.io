Next Saturday I’ll be speaking at WebNextConf during its second edition. I spoke there in the past about [Orchard CMS](/images/orchardproject.net) in 2012 as well.

This time I’m going to be talking about [gulp.js](/images/gulpjs.com). It’s a great tool that once setup can save you as we (/images/web)developer quite some valuable time and keyboard strokes. Best of all, it also ships with Visual Studio 2015 templates for [ASP.NET 5](/images/vnext).

The purpose of this session will be to explain what gulp.js is, going through the api it exposes. I’ll be presenting an introduction and some key takeaways to get up and running at work or your hobby project from preprocessing Less to automatically refreshing your browser.

I hope to see you there.

Grz, Kris.
