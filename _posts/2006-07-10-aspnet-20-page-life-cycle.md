When ASP.NET 2.0 was still out of reach for most people I already found on the internet a great looking diagram I downloaded in the past. All credits go to the original designer of the diagram: **Léon Andrianarivony**. Because I couldn't find the original blogpost anymore I decided to share it with you, the readers of this blog. Enjoy!
