Scott Guthrie has written an exhaustive series of articles of the upcoming Silverlight 2. I guess this is the version the majority of developers is waiting for. [**Take a look here**](/images/first-look-at-silverlight-2.aspx) to find out about what's coming to you. I'll also be looking at it when I get back home from work this evening. 
 
Grz, Kris.
