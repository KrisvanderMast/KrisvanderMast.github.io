Several months ago I purchased an iPod nano (/images/former version) and all of a sudden today it just hung. I have no indication what caused it. Luckily a collegue of mine had the same problem about a year ago with his iPod (/images/classic). The resolution, which also worked out for me to my satisfaction, is to follow this procedure:

* Lock the iPod (/images/Hold button on top)* Unlock the iPod* Simultaneous press the Menu and center button for about 5-10 seconds* The iPod reboots

Grz, Kris.
