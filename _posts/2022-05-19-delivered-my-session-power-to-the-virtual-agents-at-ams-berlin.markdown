Today I had the pleasure to talk about [Power Virtual Agents][1] at [aMS Berlin 2022][2]. I got some very nice feedback at the end of the session from the audience who were clearly interested in my experiences making chatbots. I didn't only talk about bot lifecycles and best practices but also demoed a working bot in PVA which makes also use of Power Automate (flow) and [adaptive cards][3].
