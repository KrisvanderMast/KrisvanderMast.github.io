Yesterday I went to Romania for the first time ever in my life. Reason: I went speaking at the CODECAMP conference Bucharest edition (apparently the first one they ever did in that city).  

The talk itself was titled:

> The good, the bad and the unexpected - a BOT story

I did the presentation in a large classroom at the Polytechnic university of Bucharest. The session itself was about the 2.5 years of experience me and the business teams I was working with built up while building chatbots and a full fledged multitenant bot platform and dashboard suite to follow up on conversations, test the different bots, get analytics, ...  
That's hardcore experience you don't find in any documentation and apparently the people liked it a lot.  

Unfortunately for me I only got to Romania late Friday afternoon and I had to leave again on Saturday afternoon hence I didn't have the time to at least properly visit some parts of the city Bucharest. But I for sure want to go back and explore more of this country.
