Last October Microsoft held its [Windows 10](/images/windows-10-upgrade?Wt.mc_id=DX_38656) Developer Day. Hosted in several cities around the world Russia and Belgium had the chance to kick off these global events. In Belgium they were held at 3 different places during the same day: Kortrijk, Hasselt and Brussels. The Hasselt presentations were recorded and put on [Channel 9](/images/Windows-10-Dev-Day-Belgium?Wt.mc_id=DX_38656).
