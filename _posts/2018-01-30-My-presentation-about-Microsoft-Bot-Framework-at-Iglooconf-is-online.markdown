Recently I presented at Iglooconf in Finland. Besides a very well organized conference and 100 attendees we also had around 500 online spectators who followed live. I only could fly in on Thursday, yes that day that in Amsterdam hundreds of flights were cancelled due to the cyclone bomb, but I made it. My first time in a Scandinavian country ever so that was already an adventure on its own. Friendly people, good food, snow, almost no sunlight, ... lovely. Besides that also a great opportunity to see some international frieds again and to make new friends.  

What also intrigued me were the offices of [Kompozure][1], one of the main organizers of the conference. Their office was really impressive and fun to be at. They triggered the idea for me to also get a 43" screen to code on. More on that in a follow up post.

As you're likely here for the recording of the talk about Microsoft Bot Framework here goes: [Youtube][2].

A very nice gift provided by the organization was the little book [Finnish nightmares][3] by Karoliina Korhonen. My wife and I both enjoyed reading it and looking up the similarities between the Flemish and Finnish culture.

Kris.
