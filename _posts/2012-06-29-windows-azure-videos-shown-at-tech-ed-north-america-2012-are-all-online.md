As many of you out there I wasn’t able to attend Tech Ed North America 2012 either so I couldn’t go to all the cool sessions showing off about the newly released features of [Windows Azure](/images/ "Windows Azure"). Luckily for you and me Channel 9 has put all the recordings available for watching and/or downloading: [http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2012?sort=status&direction=asc&t%5B0%5D=windows%2Bazure#tab\_sortBy\_status](/images/2012?sort=status&direction=asc&t%5B0%5D=windows%2Bazure#tab_sortBy_status "http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2012?sort=status&direction=asc&t%5B0%5D=windows%2Bazure#tab_sortBy_status").
