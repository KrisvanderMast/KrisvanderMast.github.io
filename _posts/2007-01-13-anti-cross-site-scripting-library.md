Microsoft recently release the new version of their Anti-Cross Site Scripting (/images/XSS) Library, currently at version 1.5. [You can download and find more information about it here](/images/default.aspx?tabid=62#antixss "Anti-Cross Site Scripting Library"). If you're concerned about security in ASP.NET give this library a try.

Grz, Kris.
