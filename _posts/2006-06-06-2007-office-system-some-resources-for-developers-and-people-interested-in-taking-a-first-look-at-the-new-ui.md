Most people are getting aware of the new upcoming version of Office. There are already several resources available and I thought I'd list some:

Some videos: [Channel 9 In the office](/images/In_the_Office) 
Some report by Forrester: [Developers get ready for 2007 Office system](/images/Forr%20060522%20Rymer%20-%20Developers,%20Get%20Ready%202007%20Office.pdf) 
A quick introduction to the new UI of 2007 Office System: [First look 2007 Office System](/images/First-Look-2007-Microsoft-Office-System.pdf) 
extension code samples, supplemental developer white papers: [2007 Office System Starter Kit: Enterprise Content Management Starter Kit](/images/details.aspx?FamilyID=38ca6b32-44be-4489-8526-f09c57cd13a5&displaylang=en)

Grz, Kris.
