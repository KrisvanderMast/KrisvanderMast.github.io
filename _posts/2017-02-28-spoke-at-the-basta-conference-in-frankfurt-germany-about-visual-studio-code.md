Last week Thursday I did my first presentation in Germany at the [Basta! conference in Frankfurt](/images/kris-van-der-mast). I had a [fully packed room](/images/834692795466133504) and had a blast. Being one of the few English only sessions kind of made me to believe up front that I would only have a couple of attendees. Luckily for me that didn’t turn out to be the case. Attentive audience and interested in what I had to say and show. I got a good interaction and was able to make the German audience laugh on several occasions. Not sure if that happens a lot but I found it a positive indication.

After the session I also got a question about chatbots as I mentioned it during my presentation that I’m currently working on one at my client (/images/Bing spellchecker, LUIS, Watson). He introduced me to his manager and I had a lengthy talk about the subject with them about chatbots, data privacy, differences for freelancers/organizations between Germany and Belgium. Later on I saw some of the attendants of my session and asked for some feedback. They liked the session a lot and wanted to install Visual Studio Code and give it a spin. Mission accomplished! All in all I had a blast during Basta!
