I've read some good feedback on this tool before and also installed it at work where I use SQL Server 2005 Management studio on a daily basis. 
Once you get used to Intellisense in visual studio.net you always get that creepy feeling: where's Intellisense when you want to query your database? Well, SQL Prompt fills that gap and saves you valuable time while developing or creating another inner join. The tool can be [downloaded here for free](/images/index.htm) until September 1st 2006.
