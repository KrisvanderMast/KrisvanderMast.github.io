Several Belgian user groups, *BIWUG, VISUG, SQLUG, IT-Talks, and Pro-Exchange*, will be having a community day on juni 28th. If you're living in Belgium, eager to learn, and just want to talk to peers or have the opportunity to meet new people with the same interests, be sure to check it out!

I also would've loved to come but due to obligations at work I'm unable to attend.

Grz, Kris.
