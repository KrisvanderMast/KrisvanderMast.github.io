Following people on [Twitter](/images/KvdM) can not only be fun but also rewarding. [Dana Coffey](/images/crazeegeekchick.com) recently twitted about a tool that can be very handy: [Color Palette Generator](/images/index.php). Just upload a picture and it’ll grab the palette. You can also let it generate a css file with the colors in it.

Grz, Kris.
