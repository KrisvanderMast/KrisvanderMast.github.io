Just read on twitter that [Glimmer](/images/Glimmer-a-jQuery-Interactive-Design-Tool) got out today.

Taken from the release announcement:

*Glimmer: a jQuery Interactive Design Tool is a prototype from the Mix Online Labs which makes jQuery accessible through a visual tool. The objective for Glimmer is pretty simple: to enable the power of jQuery through an interactive design surface. If jQuery is the "write less, do more” JavaScript library, then Glimmer is the “write none, do more” jQuery design tool. Glimmer has three core audiences: power users, designers and developers.*

This is a video overview of the features.

The team behind it had extensibility in mind so it’s possible to create custom wizards yourself. There are samples available and another great thing: the source code’s going to be available on codeplex! According to the video it’s already there but when I did a quick search I didn’t get a result yet.

Update: perhaps the video was wrong as when I downloaded the bits I noticed that there was also a download link to the source on [code.msdn.microsoft.com](/images/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=2578).

I just downloaded and installed it and gave it a test spin. It looks pretty good. I hope to give a more deep dive testing next weekend.

Grz, Kris.
