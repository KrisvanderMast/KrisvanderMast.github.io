![Happy birthday .NET - 20 years][1]

Today marks the day of 20 years of .NET. 20 years... That's almost the same life span of fresh graduates.

I remember the days that C# and .NET were announced and on July 1st later that year was introduced at the company where I worked back then. The Java people were making fun of the language that was the _Microsoft Java lookalike rip off_ back then. Well 20 years forward in time and both languages still co exist next to one another. C# has gone through quite some upgrades of which I remember Linq to be one of the most compelling ones. It got to new devices, multi platform, reborn in some ways like a phoenix (.NET Core). It's been quite a ride and I wish .NET many more decades to celebrate. In what form it will evolve I don't know, but I do know it's going to be an exciting ride along the way.
