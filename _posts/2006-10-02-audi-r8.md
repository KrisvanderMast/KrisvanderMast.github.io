Currently I drive an Audi A4 and am very satisfied of that car. Luckely because I drive about 1000 - 1200 km / week for my work.

Well, I just found out about this new [Audi R8](/images/index.php?lang=en "Audi R8") thanks to [Coolz0r's blog](/images/kick-ass-mini-site-for-audi-r8). Man does this car look hot or what? I would certainly like to testdrive this one myself.

Grz, Kris.
