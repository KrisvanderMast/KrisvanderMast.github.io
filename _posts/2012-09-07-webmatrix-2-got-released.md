I’ve been using this little gem since the first betas a couple of years ago, delivered tons of feedback to Microsoft when they were developing the betas of the new WebMatrix 2. Seriously there’s been a ton of cool, newly added, fresh smelling awesomeness to be found in this final version 2.0 release.

What I love about it is the better Intellisense, the fact that you can now also code node.js and PHP in it, better support for databases and that one can start creating custom plugins! There are already several available and I’m certain there will be way more over time. The emulators for iPhone, iPad and Windows Phone are nicely done and it shows Microsoft has taken care of the mobile side of site development.[![WebMatrix2](/images/WebMatrix2_3.png "WebMatrix2")](/images/ "Microsoft WebMatrix 2")

Not only this but search has also been enhanced and now you can also connect to a running SQL Server or MySQL database. Publishing after creating something cool and share it with the world through the built in publishing tool. [It’s also easy to go deploy the cloud](/images/webmatrix-2-is-released-new-windows-azure-features.aspx "WebMatrix 2 is Released! + New Windows Azure Features").
