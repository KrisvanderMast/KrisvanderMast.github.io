My company [Ordina](/images/www.ordina.be "Ordina Belgium") gave me the opportunity to follow a 2 day course to become a Scrum Master. The course itself was given by [Mitch Lacey](/images/ "Mitch Lacey") who gave some great information about Scrum itself and gave the entire group, about 30+ attendees, several exercises to accomplish. These introduced people to think about solutions and create a group spirit. I liked this hands on approach a lot.

Grz, Kris.
