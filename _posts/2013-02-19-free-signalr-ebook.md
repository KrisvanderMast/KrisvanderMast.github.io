[SignalR](/images/announcing-release-of-asp-net-and-web-tools-2012-2-update.aspx) [went](/images/ReleasedASPNETAndWebTools20122InContext.aspx) [RTW](/images/signalr.net) last Monday which is awesome. Which is even more awesome is that at the MVP summit I got to know about a book being published by a fellow MVP about this great technology:

[![signalR-cover](/images/signalR-cover_3.png "signalR-cover")](/images/ "SignalR ebook")

The current version of the book is still about the RC2 edition but they promise to update it really soon so [be sure to grab the goods and start using SignalR](/images/signalr-ebook).

Grz, Kris.
