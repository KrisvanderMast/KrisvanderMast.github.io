Since I became an MVP I also got into the VIP pool of people. This was my first time but it was nice to see some other Belgian MVP's but also others that made it to the VIP pool thanks to their outstanding community awareness. First we had an informal meeting as to what direction Microsoft sees the community going and where the VIPs see it going. Not all people were developers but also IT pro's were there. Some of them I already knew but most of these people were strangers to me. After we had introduced ourselves there was an IT pro that came to me and said: "thanks for the help on the forums". Apparently he had asked a question on the ASP.NET forums and I helped him out (/images/and actually gave a correct answer too).

After that meeting we settled down in our hotel rooms, a very nice hotel in Ostend (/images/Golden Tulip Bero). After that we gathered for a small game in Ostend where we had to find several key locations and put a card on a board that corresponded with something we could see in the neighbourhood. It was fun and actually the team I was in did win. After the competition we had a nice dinner in the Kursaal (/images/a known building in Ostend). After that we gathered in a lounge bar with a lot of possible cocktails. I had some nice chats with several people that evening/night and not everything was tech related.

The day afterwards, which came too soon as I nearly couldn't sleep during those 4 hours I spent in the hotels bed, I was the first of the group to eat breakfast. But soon several other members of the group joined me so I immediately had some new conversations going on.

Normally at 10 o'clock the group would gather to play some other games but some of us had to leave. I was one of them as I went to Westend to team up with my parents.

Actually I had a lot of fun and want to thank the people that made it possible for me to attend it and I hope to see the other VIP people back soon.
