[Codeplex](/images/ "Codeplex") is a great resource to find all kinds of things developer related. One of the things I found recently were a bunch of snippets for [jQuery](/images/www.jquery.com "jQuery") to make life easier for developers using Visual Studio 2010. You can [download them here](/images/ "jQuery code snippets for Visual Studio 2010").

Grz, Kris.
