During my studies of becoming an engineer I found marketing one of my most interesting side courses. During the last years I tried to follow blogs like the one of Seth Godin and was greatly amused by the Apple commercials. 
 
Well today I found out about a great way that Google made up to show Chrome, their new browser, to the masses in the form of a [**comic book**](/images/chrome). I think it's just great marketing. I haven't tried out the Chrome browser myself yet but I'm looking forward to it. Not just because of the marketing behind it (/images/I like to read comic books myself a lot so that also added to the appeal) but also from the point of view of a webdeveloper. Especially the javascript V8 engine looks very interesting with all kinds of AJAX web applications nowadays and if it's really as fast as they claim I'm highly interested. 
 
Exciting times ahead with the newest release of Firefox (/images/3) and the upcoming IE8. Since I also like to use a Mac I also use Safari nowadays. Aaah, I see a new browser war coming already like in the good old days between Netscape and Internet Explorer. 
 
Grz, Kris.
