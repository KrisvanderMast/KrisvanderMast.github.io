Sometimes you simply want to test out something without opening a new text editor, put basic things together just to make it work. Or you don’t want to create another new project3456 in Visual Studio. Well I got some good news if you also find yourself in that position. You can go to these websites to find yourself quickly checking something out, pass on that code to others and easily show it in a forum.

Of course there are many others out there but these are already a great place to start fiddling around ![Smile](/images/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png).
