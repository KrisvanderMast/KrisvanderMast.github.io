Not so long ago I blogged about [new video material on ASP.NET 3.5 and LINQ](/images/NewVideoMaterialOnASPNET35AndLINQ.aspx). Since I didn't have much time lately to keep up with my blogreading I just found out through the blog of my buddy [Bilal](/images/www.bhaidar.net) that there are also videos available on: 

* [VS 2008 & .NET 3.5 Video Training](/images/videos_orcas.aspx)
* [LINQ Video Training](/images/videos_linq.aspx)

[Anyone got some time left](/images/CanYouStillFollowUpWithMicrosoft.aspx)? 
 
Grz, Kris.
