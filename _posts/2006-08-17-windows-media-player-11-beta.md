Just installed the Beta version of [Windows Media Player 11](/images/default.aspx). The new and upcoming version. I like it a lot until now, especially the new button style of Vista. I could only wish that Microsoft decided to have the same kind of buttons in the default, so no Glass or Aero, mode of Windows Vista as well.

Grz, Kris.
