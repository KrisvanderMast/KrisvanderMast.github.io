Just saw that Scott Mitchell, of [4guysfromrolla](/images/www.4guysfromrolla.com) fame, announced that he's busy writing tutorials about [working with data in ASP.NET 2.0](/images/8007.aspx). You can find the tutorials in the [Learn section](/images/default.aspx?tabid=63) of the [ASP.NET official site](/images/www.asp.net) among other tutorials like videos's, starter kits, ... Be sure to check out the [Working with data in ASP.NET 2.0 tutorials](/images/default.aspx?tabid=63). They're also downloadable in pdf format in both VB.NET and C#.

Grz, Kris.
