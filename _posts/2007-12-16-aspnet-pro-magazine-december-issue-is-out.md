I got notified that the [latest issue's out](/images/aspDEC2007.pdf). It's nice to see that magazines are also offering their material online for free. Of course it comes with adds but that's their survival of course. Another very nice magazine which puts their content online is [MSDN Magazine](/images/msdnmag). Nice to see that Microsoft spreads the .NET word this way.

Grz, Kris.
