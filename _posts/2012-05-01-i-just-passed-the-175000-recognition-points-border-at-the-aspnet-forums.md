I just noticed I passed the 175.000 recognition points border at [forums.asp.net](/images/forums.asp.net). Cool! Does this mean something special? Well not at first glance but it does mean that I tried to help out a lot of people worldwide trying to solve their small or big problems while working on real world projects.
