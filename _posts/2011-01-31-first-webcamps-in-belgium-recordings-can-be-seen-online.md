Last week a Scott Hanselman came to Belgium for the first [Webcamps](/images/ "Webcamps"). I could only attend the first 2 hours due to client obligations but I was glad to see quite some familiar faces and Scott performing in his usual way during the first part of the whole show. Luckily for everyone who couldn’t attend, or only partially like myself, the entire day got recorded. You can watch the shows here: <http://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Web-Camp-Belgium-2011/>.
