Today was a great day. I graduated _cum laude_ my [postgraduate studies in Big Data & Analytics in Business and Management at KUL university][1]. I'm really happy with the result. I got a 15/20 for my thesis.  

I'd like to thank my professors for the interesting courses, [SD Worx Belgium][2] as I was allowed to make my thesis about a project I did for them, and my family for the support.  

During the last year I've learned a lot about Big Data, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, ... I'm sure I'll be able to apply this knowledge in my day to day job. 

The thesis itself was very interesting but also quite time consuming and I took several weeks of unpaid leave to be able to finish it. I'm glad I did it as I learned a lot from it. The topic was to __predict employee churn__. Data cleaning with [Python][3] and [Pandas][4] turned out to be the biggest part of the code. I used [sci-kit learn][5] to train several models and used the best performing one to predict employee churn. [Matplotlib][6] and [Seaborn][7] were used to visualize the data.
