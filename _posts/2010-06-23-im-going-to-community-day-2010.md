Tomorrow’s Community day in Belgium. Meaning: a day full of great content provided by all Belgian user groups. I plan on following these courses:

* Keynote
* Visual Studio 2010 Lab Manager
* What’s new in .NET 4.0
* Taking care of a cloud environment
* Linq for supermodels
* Building an enterprise application with Silverlight and NHibernate
* Developing Windows Phone applications with Silverlight
