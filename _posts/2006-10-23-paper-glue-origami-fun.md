When I was still a kid I enjoyed creating stuff from paper or carton. A bit of glue and scissors and lots of fun. Also origami was something I enjoyed and it wouldn't be the first time I folded a [Crane](/images/crane_e.html "Origami crane").

I stumbled upon this site today but I did find a great resource of paper models and origami that you can print out and fold. Boy, why didn't this stuff exist 20 years ago?

Well, here's the link to the good stuff: [http://cp.c-ij.com/english/3D-papercraft/](/images/ "http://cp.c-ij.com/english/3D-papercraft/").

If someone knows where I can find a tutorial on creating a paper/carton clock please tell me.

Update: Malcolm Metzler emailed me with this link: <http://www.yamaha-motor.co.jp/global/entertainment/papercraft/index.html>. Looks great.

Grz, Kris.
