It was lingering for some time but I finally made it across the border of the magical number of 150.000 recognition points over at the [ASP.NET forums](/images/forums.asp.net "ASP.NET forums"). I’m glad I did as it shows the appreciation of those thousands of people I have helped out in the past trying to find their solution for their problems. I don’t know to how many applications my answers made a difference in order to get things done and shipped with happy customers as an end result but I’m sure it were more than just a few.
