The last couple of weeks I got several questions about my article on [creating custom macros for dasBlog](/images/CreatingCustomMacrosForDasBlog.aspx). The biggest problem seems to be that most people run dasBlog under ASP.NET 1.1 while the macros were created in .NET 2.0. Xerratus made an article about it a while ago but I would like to point out to it since it's not an isolated story. The article can be found here: [DasBlog custom macros "error" solved](/images/DasBlogCustomMacrosErrorSolved.aspx).

Grz, Kris.
