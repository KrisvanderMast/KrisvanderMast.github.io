Today I had the pleasure of giving a presentation about Azure Web Jobs at a nice conference in Poland. It was well organized in a good hotel close to Gdynia. For me it was the first time ever I spoke, and been, in Poland. Attendees and hosts were all very nice people and I noticed a good amount of interest in Azure. I hope to be able to come back to talk more about Azure next year as well.

As a personal note: it’s been my first time to Poland and I really enjoyed it. I’m already thinking of going there on a short holiday with the misses and get to know the country better next year.

Grz, Kris.
