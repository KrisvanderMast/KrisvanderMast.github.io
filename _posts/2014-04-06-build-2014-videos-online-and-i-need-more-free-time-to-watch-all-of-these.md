Last week was Microsoft’s //Build/ 2014 edition. I couldn’t be there in person but luckily for most of us around the globe the sessions got recorded and put online on [Channel 9](/images/ "Microsoft Channel 9"). There’s more than these but this is some handpicking done by me, and to keep a nice (/images/short)list for myself to keep track of what I want to see from it.

First of all start with the Keynotes. I watched already the second one with [Scott Guthrie](/images/scottgu "Scott Guthrie's blog") which was mostly about [Azure, web and Rosslyn](/images/KEY02 "//Build/ 2014 keynote 2").
