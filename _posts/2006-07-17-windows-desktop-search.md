I finally gave Windows Desktop Search a try. It still needs to index quite some files but I already like it a lot. Since I have a lot of documents containing code on my development PC I can use the tool to quickly search in all files at once.

If you're interested you can go the files here: [Windows Desktop Search](/images/default.mspx), or [take the tour](/images/demo.html).

I also found an interesting article related to this: [Bring Windows Desktop Search Into Visual Studio With Our Cool Add-In](/images/default.aspx). I didn't try that one out yet.

Grz, Kris.
