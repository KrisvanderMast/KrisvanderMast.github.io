I just read this news: [Windows Live Gallery goes 2.0](/images/ "Permalink").

Taken from the original blog post:

*Now you have one-stop-shopping for all your miniapps; Sidebar Gadgets, Toolbar buttons, Web Gadgets, SideShow Gadgets, as well as appearance properties like Display Pictures, Emoticons, and Messenger Winks. 
 
While some of the areas, like Emoticons and Winks, are not populated yet, the other areas are fully staffed including* [*all 807 Sidebar Gadgets*](/images/results.aspx?bt=1&pl=1)*.*

You can visit the gallery directly at <http://gallery.live.com/>

Grz, Kris.
