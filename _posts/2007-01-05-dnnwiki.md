Hi,

since I'm a contributing member of the [Visug site](/images/ "VISUG Belgian User Group"), a Belgian user group, I was asked to create a custom module for DNN. Since I never before played around with DNN I found this site to quite interesting for beginners: [DNNWiki.NET](/images/ "DotNetNuke Wiki"). Especially the video tutorials were very interesting to get started with building your own custom modules for the platform.

Update: I just noticed my buddy Gill Cleeren wrote an article about [How-to: DotNetNuke: Installation](/images/Howto+DotNetNuke+Installation.aspx). Check it out if you're interested on setting it up on Vista with IIS7.

Grz, Kris.
