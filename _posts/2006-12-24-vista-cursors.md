Ok, if you like the new Vista Aero cursors but don't have Vista installed yet you can [download them here](/images/Aero_Cursors.zip "Vista cursors"). Just unzip the file in the c:\windows\cursors\ location. I noticed that I had to move the cursors still to that location before I let the .reg file run in order to get them installed as being the current cursor set to use on Windows XP.

Grz, Kris.
