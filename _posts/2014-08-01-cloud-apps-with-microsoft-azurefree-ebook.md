When you look outside of the window and you notice the weather’s not making you feel to go and sit outside to enjoy it you might as well read a good book. Microsoft released an ebook that’ll go well with the cloudy weather but will at least make you fee more happy than the actual weather does.

To grab a copy go over to [Cloud apps with Microsoft Azure](/images/free-ebook-building-cloud-apps-with-microsoft-azure.aspx "Cloud apps with Microsoft Azure"): *Best practices for DevOps, data storage, high availability, and more*, by Scott Guthrie, Mark Simms, Tom Dykstra, Rick Anderson, and Mike Wasson..

You can opt to go for these choices:

* [pdf](/images/CloudApps_PDF "Building Cloud Apps with Microsoft Azure")
* [epub](/images/CloudApps_EPUB "Building Cloud Apps with Microsoft Azure")
* [mobi](/images/CloudApps_MOBI "Building Cloud Apps with Microsoft Azure")
