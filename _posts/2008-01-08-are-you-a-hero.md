Because [Heroes happen {here}](/images/default.aspx). 
 

*March 11 sees the official launch of brand new versions of Windows Server
2008, SQL Server 2008 and Visual Studio 2008. But what the day is really about
are the everyday heroes who transform our products into powerful products for
solving real IT problems at work. In other words, you.*

*We are calling it **Heroes Happen Here**. And we're proud to
invite miracle workers like yourself, not only to the launch itself, but also to
our TechDays 2008. A series of technical sessions that take place on 12th and
13th March, during which IT professionals and developers alike will get the
chance to go into every single aspect of each pack. So if you'd like to boost
your powers even further, this is one event you don't want to miss.*

I hope I'm able to see you guys/girls over there those days. 
 
Grz, Kris.
