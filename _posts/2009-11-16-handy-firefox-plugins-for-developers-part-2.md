[A while ago I already showed several handy plugins I like to use](/images/HandyFirefoxPluginsForWebDevelopers.aspx). Of course the world keeps on turning and new plugins are created or I just happen to stumble on little gems by accident. Here are some other plugins that I like to use:

**[Dust-me selectors](/images/dustmeselectors)**: finds unused CSS selectors. It extracts all the selectors from all the stylesheets on the page you're viewing, then analyzes that page to see which of those selectors are not used. The data is then stored so that when testing subsequent pages, selectors can be crossed off the list as they're encountered. You can test pages individually, **or spider an entire site**, and you'll end up with a profile of which selectors are not used anywhere.

**[View source chart](/images/655)**: A handy way to visualize the generated html.

**[Page speed](/images/page-speed)**: Page Speed is an open-source Firefox/Firebug Add-on. Webmasters and web developers can use Page Speed to evaluate the performance of their web pages and to get suggestions on how to improve them. A handy plugin by Google.

Grz, Kris.
