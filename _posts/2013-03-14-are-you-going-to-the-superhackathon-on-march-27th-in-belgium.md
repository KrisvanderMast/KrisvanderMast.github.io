One day – four locations – on site experts – prizes – fun. That’s basically what’s going to happen on March 27th at four different locations in our cozy Belgian country. You can opt between:

* [Brussels](/images/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032545515&Culture=en-US)
* [Genk](/images/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032545528&Culture=en-US)
* [Mons](/images/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032545534&Culture=en-US)
* [Kortrijk](/images/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032545531&Culture=en-US)

Like in the past there are 2 main sessions: one at day and one at night so you can choose yourself when you want to sleep or try to win a prize. Talking about prizes this might certainly interest you and get you engaged:

* 1st Place: free & full entrance to [TechEd Madrid](/images/www.msteched.com) 25-28 June
* 2nd Place: Marvellous Asus Vivo Tab
* 3rd Place: Hot Windows Phone 8

Of course something cool like this isn’t real before you see a banner so here you go:
