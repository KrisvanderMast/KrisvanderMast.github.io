This day we had a successful demo of our ongoing effort to create a great application for our current client [BICS](/images/ "BICS"). No crashes at all (/images/is that a good demo?) so we were quite happy afterwards. The client itself was very content about the results we already achieved during the last iteration (/images/we're using SCRUM like methodology for this particular project).

Most of the times a consultancy company gathers several of its employees and let them create a custom made application. This project's a more unique approach for me: 4 developers with different backgrounds from different companies and it works out well. Very well actually. There's a good motivation in the team, we also did some Saturday work recently, and there's also a good atmosphere around. It's great to be a part in such a team.

And for now, up to the next deadline of December 21st.

Grz, Kris.
