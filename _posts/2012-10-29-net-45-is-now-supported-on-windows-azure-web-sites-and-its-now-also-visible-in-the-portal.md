[Last week there was already the news that .NET 4.5, the latest version of the framework at this moment, was deployed on Windows Azure Web Sites](/images/net-4-5-now-supported-with-windows-azure-web-sites.aspx). However what confused a lot of people was that it didn’t show up in the portal. As of now it does.

So instead of seeing this under the Configure tab:

[![windowsazurewebsites_frameworkversion_01](/images/windowsazurewebsites_frameworkversion_01_thumb.png "windowsazurewebsites_frameworkversion_01")](/images/windowsazurewebsites_frameworkversion_01.png)

You’ll now see:

[![windowsazurewebsites_frameworkversion_02](/images/windowsazurewebsites_frameworkversion_02_thumb_1.png "windowsazurewebsites_frameworkversion_02")](/images/windowsazurewebsites_frameworkversion_02_1.png)

Now only the current version of node.js needs to be added to the portal. Btw, [that’s 0.6.20](/images/FindOutWhichVersionOfNodejsCurrentlyRunsOnWindowsAzureWebSites.aspx "Which version of node.js is currently running on Windows Azure Web Sites").

Also be sure to [check out this screencast at Channel 9 about the upgrade to .NET 4.5](/images/NET-Framework-45-Support-in-Windows-Azure-Web-Sites).

Grz, Kris.
