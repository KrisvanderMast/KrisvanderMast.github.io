Since several years javascript has become increasingly more popular. Because of that a slew of frameworks and libraries became available and usually there starts the journey for developers to spend their, usually free, time to learn it all. The choice is so overwhelming nowadays that it becomes hard to focus and choose those frameworks in which one wants to excel.

Luckily there’s such an initiative as [TodoMVC](/images/ "TodoMVC") which gives a slew of code samples for the same application, a todo list, built with different javascript frameworks. A very interesting approach and one to keep in the back of your mind the next time you want to start a new SPA (/images/Single Page Application).
