Scott Guthrie has been blogging several days since last week about new cool things coming out soon: [IIS Express](/images/introducing-iis-express.aspx "IIS Express"), [SQL Server Compact Edition](/images/new-embedded-database-support-with-asp-net.aspx "SQL Server Compact Edition") & [Razor](/images/introducing-razor.aspx "Razor"). That means in that order: a follow up for Cassini, an equivalent for SQL Lite and a new cool viewengine which can be used in [ASP.NET MVC](/images/mvc "ASP.NET MVC").

But today there was something new which got it all together to make websites: [WebMatrix](/images/ "Webmatrix").

Taken from the announcement at the [ASP.NET forums](/images/1576335.aspx):

*WebMatrix includes a complete Web development stack that integrates a Web server (/images/IIS Developer Express), database (/images/Microsoft SQL Server Compact 4.0), programming model (/images/ASP.NET Web pages with Razor syntax), and a tool (/images/WebMatrix Beta) into a seamless experience. You can use WebMatrix to streamline the way you create an ASP.NET Web site from templates, or by starting a new Web site by using the world’s most popular free and open source (/images/ASP.NET or PHP) apps like DotNetNuke, Umbraco, WordPress, or Joomla!. With WebMatrix you can code your Web sites, customize them, optimize them for good search engine ranking, test them, and deploy them to an Internet hosting company, all through the tool.*

*Learn more about WebMatrix through:*

I like the stapled blocks which form the logo of this new free tool:

[![webx-stack-gfx](/images/webx-stack-gfx_3.png "webx-stack-gfx")](/images/ "Webmatrix")

And here’s an introduction video about it:

[![WebMatrix Video Player: Overview](/images/webx-watch-overview.jpg)](/images/intro.mp4 "Introduction to WebMatrix")

If you want to play with it I say go! Razor’s pretty cool to play around with it and if you have question then there are 2 dedicated forums already available:

Over at forums.asp.net: <http://forums.asp.net/1224.aspx>. 
Over at <http://forums.iis.net/1166.aspx>

Also be sure to read on Scott Guthries blog the [announcement of WebMatrix](/images/introducing-webmatrix.aspx?CommentPosted=true#commentmessage "Webmatrix").

The big question you might want to ask yourself now is, is this for me? And the answer would yes, it is. According to the Microsoft site:

*WebMatrix is for developers, students, or just about anyone who just wants a small and simple way to build Web sites. Start coding, testing, and deploying your own Web sites without having to worry about configuring your own Web server, managing databases, or learning a lot of concepts. WebMatrix makes Web site development easy.*

I would say: welcome to the (/images/Web)Matrix! Be sure to take the right pill.

Grz, Kris.
