Yesterday evening I had the pleasure to attend the [presentations by Scott Guthrie](/images/ScottGuthriesComingToBelgium.aspx). It was very interesting to see what's coming up in the new version of Visual Studio codenamed 'Orcas'. I like the multi-targeting feature, now you can choose which .NET framework you want to target your solution to: 2.0, 3.0 or 3.5. Another nice feature, and something I'm looking forward to is Javascript intellisense. This'll be a great feature once someone starts developing with ASP.NET AJAX.

Afterwards we had the chance to talk to Scott directly and some group pictures were taken by [Sven Mus](/images/www.neomatics.be). I hope he posts them quickly so I can also share them.

Grz, Kris.
