I just found out that Telerik's creating a code conversion tool: [http://converter.telerik.com/](/images/ "http://converter.telerik.com/"). It looks pretty slick with AJAX integration. No wonder because Telerik's been very busy on that part.

Another conversion tool that I used during the last couple of years are these: [C# to VB.NET](/images/convertcsharptovb.aspx) and [VB.NET to C#](/images/convertvbtocsharp.aspx).

Update: [Gill](/images/www.snowball.be) pointed out in the comments that [#Develop](/images/Default.aspx) also has this functionality.

Grz, Kris.
