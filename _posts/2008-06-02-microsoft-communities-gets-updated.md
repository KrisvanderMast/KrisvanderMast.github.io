I used [**this site**](/images/www.mscommunities.com) already before but then it only showed just plain links to blog articles or channel 9 videos. When I just took a look it was completely restyled. The Silverlight usage for the ticker looks pretty interesting but seems to lack content at the moment of writing. 
 
Grz, Kris.
