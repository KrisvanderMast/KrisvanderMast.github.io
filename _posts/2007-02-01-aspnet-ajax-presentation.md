Yesterday evening I gave a presentation about ASP.NET AJAX. About 30 attendees came to see some small demos about the UpdatePanel, giving precedence to certain async callbacks or cancelling one. Apparently everyone liked the demo material and the response was good.

I also used ZoomIt, a free utility that's really helpfull during presentations, during the session. No more changing font sizes etc. [You can download it here](/images/zoomit.mspx "ZoomIt").

I'll post the demo + slides after some cleaning up and providing somewhat more detailed information to better understand the demo's without the explanation of the speaker.

This evening I'll also be attending the talk provided by Scott Guthrie so I hope to see some familiar faces there too.

Another interesting thing to note: the source code of ASP.NET AJAX Extensions has been made available. [Grab the bits here](/images/details.aspx?FamilyID=ef2c1acc-051a-4fe6-ad72-f3bed8623b43&DisplayLang=en "ASP.NET AJAX Extensions source code").

Another thing to note: Apparently there's a small issue with the current release of ASP.NET AJAX but there's a workaround. Take a look at the following article: [How to work around the "Access denied" cross-domain frame issue in ASP.NET Ajax 1.0.](/images/how-to-work-around-the-quot-access-denied-quot-cross-domain-frame-issue-in-asp-net-ajax-1-0.aspx)

Grz, Kris.
