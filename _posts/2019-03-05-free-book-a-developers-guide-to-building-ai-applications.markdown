I noticed that Microsoft hands out a free ebook about AI and chatbots. It's an easy read of about 50 pages.

![AI book](/images/ai-book.png)

The __table of contents__ is as follows:  

* Introduction
* The intersection of Cloud, Data and AI
* The Microsoft AI platform
* Developing an intelligent chatbot
* Adding plug and play intelligence to your bot
* Building an enterprise app to gain bot insights: the conference buddy dashboard
* Paving the road ahead

If you want your copy you can [__download it here__](https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-ai-developers-bot-ebook.html?wt.mc_id=AID723408_QSG_SCL_321411).
