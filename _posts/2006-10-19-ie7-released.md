I've been using IE7 since the betas and really liked the new version. Especially the tabbed pages and the overview that you can take of all open windows on 1 page is a great experience. I don't really use the built in RSS capabilities at the moment as I use [GreatNews](/images/ANewFeedreader.aspx "GreatNews") to read my subscribed feeds. The integrated search and the possibility to select a different search engine is something I was fond of when using FireFox. Now it's also integrated in IE.

You can download IE7 or take a tour of the features here: [http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.mspx](/images/default.mspx "http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.mspx").

Grz, Kris.
