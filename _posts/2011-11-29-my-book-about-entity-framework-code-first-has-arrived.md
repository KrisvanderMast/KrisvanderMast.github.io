I got a new book to read: Entity Framework Code First by [Julie Lerman](/images/ "Julie Lerman blog").

It’s a rather small book but I know what I’ll be doing during the holidays soon. There are 8 chapters covered in this book:

1. Welcome to code first: a high level and end to end overview
2. First look at code first
3. Using conventions for property attributes
4. Using conventions for relationships
5. Using conventions for database mappings
6. Controlling database location, creation process and seed data
7. Advanced concepts
8. What’s coming next for code first

Grz, Kris.
