In October I gave a presentation about [Visual Studio Code][1] during [Microsoft Tech Days NL 2017][2]. Well, that session got recorded and is now available on [Youtube][3]. The downside for me was that I only got 45 minutes for this session so I had to narrow down quite a lot but still wanted to show a lot of the coolness of the product itself. I gave the same session as well during Tuga IT in Lisbon, Portugal and Basta! in Frankfurt, Germany with great succes but there I got an hour which was more comfortable.
