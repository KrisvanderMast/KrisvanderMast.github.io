I'm using dasBlog for nearly a year now and am quite pleased with it. Since recently [Mads Kristensen](/images/netslave) decided to get his hands dirty and create a new blogengine that he likes to share with the rest of the community by making it open source on [CodePlex](/images/www.codeplex.com). Way to go!!

If you're interested you can grab the source code here: [http://www.codeplex.com/blogengine](/images/blogengine "http://www.codeplex.com/blogengine").

Grz, Kris.
