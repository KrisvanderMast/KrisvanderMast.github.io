Ok, it seems this year has been the year of new technologies from Microsoft and yet [new stuff's coming out](/images/asp-net-3-5-extensions-ctp-preview-released.aspx). I found this blog post from Julie Lerman that had a talk with [Scott Guthrie](/images/scottgu) on how to handle everything that comes out of the firehose: [ScottGu on how to deal with the Microsoft firehose](/images/ScottGuOnHowToDealWithTheMicrosoftFirehose.aspx).

Grz, Kris.
