Hi,

if you're into Microsoft technology you'll probably know about Channel 9 and On10. While I was [surfing/investigating the revamped ASP.NET site](/images/wwwaspnetGotARefresh.aspx) I noticed a new entry in the community toolbar: **Channel 8**.

*Channel 8 is THE place to be for STUDENTS who want to code, connect and create technology. Stay plugged into tech news and share in the experience with students around the world just like you who want to see their creations come to life. This is also a back door directly into Microsoft just like* [*Channel 9*](/images/channel9.msdn.com) *but from a student point of view. This means access to the inside scoop about our products and life working inside Microsoft and information on cool things coming out. This is your community – a place for you to share your tips and tricks and even your problems. Go check out what others are doing and talk about what you think is cool.*

I hope a lot of interesting content will come up there just like on Channel 9. More to watch for all of us.

Grz, Kris.
