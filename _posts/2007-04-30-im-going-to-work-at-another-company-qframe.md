Well, another company is actually lying a bit. I got the same boss, the same collegues, ...

So what does change? Well for starters we've become an independent company while formerly we were a subdivision of quite a large company in Belgium. 
We're still a Microsoft Gold Certified Partner and the quality we deliver hasn't changed a bit either.

Check out the site and the new logo:

Grz, Kris.
