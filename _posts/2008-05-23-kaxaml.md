Just found out about this little tool that seemed interesting to me: **[Kaxaml](/images/www.kaxaml.com)**, a lightweight xamlpad alike tool. Apparently it's also free which is always a nice thing.

I found out about this tool by navigating around on the site of **[Blendables](/images/www.blendables.com)**,a vendor of WPF controls. And I got to know about this particular site thanks to **[Gill](/images/www.snowball.be)**.

Grz, Kris.
