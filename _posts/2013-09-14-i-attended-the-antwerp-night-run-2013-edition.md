Last evening 5 colleagues from [ae](/images/www.ae.be "application engineers") and me went out for an adventure: to run 9 km in het Rivierenhof without the comfort of lights except the headlights all 5700 runners were wearing. It was raining, muddy, slippery from time to time but it was awesome fun! As I only started training somewhere in August after having not been running for a couple of years I was glad that I was able to tackle this run down in 54:40 ![Smile](/images/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png).

To give you an impression of how the start looked like (/images/I’m somewhere one of those shiny lights as well):

I look forward to doing it again next year as well together with my awesome colleagues.

Update: the other pictures came online and these are my colleagues:
