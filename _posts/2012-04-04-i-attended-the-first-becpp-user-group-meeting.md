It’s been something like 10 years that I didn’t write C++ code myself anymore. When I heard my friend [Marc Gregoire](/images/main.php) started up his own user group [BeCPP](/images/blog) I decided to go and watch what’s happened over that decade. Frankly, a lot has seemed to happen. I was introduced to the new stuff that shipped with the latest C++ version and a second sessoin about the new move stuff. At some points I had to dig again on the information but overall I could still follow along.

A picture of both speakers: Marc Gregoire and Francisco Almeida:

For the people interested in both C++ and Metro be sure to check out their new session on May 8.

Grz, Kris.
