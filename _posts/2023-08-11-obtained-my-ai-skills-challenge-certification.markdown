A while ago I wrote about the upcoming [AI skills challenge][1]. I'm happy to announce that I've completed the challenge and obtained my certification.  

I decided to follow the AI Builder challenge as I've never worked with AI Builder before. It was a great experience. I learned a lot about AI Builder and I'm sure I will use it in the future. The last modules of the challenge were all about Power Virtual Agents for which I already gave several presentations at conferences and user groups so that was a great refresher.

You can see my achievements on my [Microsoft Learn profile][2].
