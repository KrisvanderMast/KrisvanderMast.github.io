The list of sessions of Techdays 2012 is practically at 100% so that makes it easy to start choosing the ones I would like to attend up front ![Smile](/images/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png).

My todo list for those days are:

### Day 1

* Keynote developers (/images/duh!)
* [The developer story: CLOUD](/images/SessionDetail.aspx?sessionId=209 "The developer story: CLOUD") (/images/Wade Wegener)
* [The Future of C# and Visual Basic](/images/SessionDetail.aspx?sessionId=200) (/images/Bart De Smet)
* [What's new in Visual Studio 11 for Application Lifecycle Management](/images/SessionDetail.aspx?sessionId=245 "Microsoft’s application lifecycle management tooling is all about enabling teams to deliver great software. In this demo-packed session, you will learn how to more effectively plan and track work by using the new Web-based project management tools; how to bridge the divide between development and operations by utilizing IntelliTrace in your production environments; and how to help keep team members on-task and “in the zone” with the new “My Work” and code review features. In addition to making your team more productive, we will show you how you can boost your overall code quality with new features such as code clone and an overhauled unit testing story in Visual Studio 11.") (/images/Brian Keller)
* [Building rich Single Page Applications (/images/SPAs) for desktop, mobile, and tablet with ASP.NET MVC 4](/images/SessionDetail.aspx?sessionId=199 "In this session, Steve will demonstrate how modern Single Page Application (/images/SPA) architecture combines the best bits of web-like and desktop-like user experience, applying libraries such as Knockout.js and Upshot.js to streamline the development process.") (/images/Steven Sanderson)

### Day 2

* [Take a Ride on the Metro](/images/SessionDetail.aspx?sessionId=268 "Use and reuse of existing skills in the brave new world.") (/images/Jeff Prosise) or [Building services for your phone and tablet applications using WebAPI](/images/SessionDetail.aspx?sessionId=240 "The Web API is a new framework for building web services in .NET. In this session you will learn how to use this framework by example as we build a service and show how it can be consumed from mobile clients such as tablets and phones.") (/images/Matt Milner)
* [Developing HTML5 Applications with Script# - Compiling C# into JavaScript](/images/SessionDetail.aspx?sessionId=208 "Script#, a free C# to JavaScript compiler, brings the power of Visual Studio and .NET Tools to build a productive and familiar development model for creating, testing and managing modern applications using HTML, CSS and JavaScript along with popular frameworks such as jQuery. This session provides a hands-on look at using Script#, shares success stories and experiences from real-world use.") (/images/Nikhil Kothari)
* [The zen of async: Best practices for best performance](/images/SessionDetail.aspx?sessionId=239 "In this session, we’ll dive deep into how async works, examining key aspects of the design and implementation that result in overheads when compared to synchronous programming. With that knowledge, we’ll tour through best practices for using async to build high-performing, scalable and responsive apps and libraries.") (/images/Alex Turner)
* [Building Cross-Platform Mobile Applications with HTML5](/images/SessionDetail.aspx?sessionId=273 "With HTML5 and PhoneGap, you can write apps that exploit native features of the operating system and run on a wide range of devices. And the recently released PhoneGap 1.3 makes Windows Phone 7 a first-class citizen in the PhoneGap environment. Join the fun as Jeff explores the world of cross-platform mobile development and demonstrates the pros and cons of going HTML5 versus going native.") (/images/Jeff Prosise)
* [What's new in Windows Workflow 4.5](/images/SessionDetail.aspx?sessionId=241 "Learn about all the new features in Workflow 4.5 including C# expression support, designer updates, state machines, dynamic update, versioning, contract-first workflow services and new base activities.") (/images/Matt Milner)
* [SignalR. Code, not toothpaste.](/images/SessionDetail.aspx?sessionId=246 "Almost all HTML5 and web applications today make use of AJAX to communicate between client and server. AJAX is great with asynchronous operations, but what about real-time communication? How would you push a message from server to client? HTML5 WebSockets offer a solution to all of these questions but are not supported in every browser and every network environment. SignalR is the new cool kid on the block: it leverages WebSockets when supported and falls back to different mechanisms when they aren’t.") (/images/Maarten Balliauw)

Grz, Kris.
