Thanks to a colleague I got to know about this free eBook: [http://read.humanjavascript.com/ch00-foreword.html](/images/ch00-foreword.html "http://read.humanjavascript.com/ch00-foreword.html").

It’s not the typical dry to read tech book and doesn’t get you started with javascript. On the contrary it reads in a nice way and talks about what the author was confronted with and how he dealt with it. Something extra to read while sitting outside in the evening sun (/images/when there is any in Belgium).

Grz, Kris.
