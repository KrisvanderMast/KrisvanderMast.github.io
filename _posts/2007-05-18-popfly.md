Just read this on the [blog of Somasegar](/images/popfly.aspx "PopFly"):

*Popfly is a tool and social network that provides a fun and easy way to build and share mash-ups, gadgets, Silverlight experiences, and Web pages using pre-built “Blocks” that connect to online services.*

I asked for an invitation as they're not giving much away at the moment. Funny thing when I visited the site was to see someone I knew: [Steven Wilssens](/images/About.aspx), a Belgian developer and MVP that went working for Microsoft since last year.

Update: I just found out about this video on [Channel9](/images/channel9.msdn.com): [PopFly](/images/showpost.aspx?postid=308460)

Grz, Kris.
