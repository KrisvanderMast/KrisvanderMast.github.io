[Joe Stagner](/images/ "Joe Stagner") is doing it again. After quite a lot video material on ASP.NET AJAX he just started doing one about AJAX patterns. For the moment there's only one video available but more will be coming in the next weeks/months from now on. The current video is about the [Predictive Fetch Pattern](/images/view.aspx?tabid=63&id=100 "Predictive Fetch Pattern").

You can learn more about AJAX patterns on the dedicated site: [ajaxpatterns.org](/images/ "AJAX patterns").

Grz, Kris.
