That time of the year again where you hope you get that email that states yes you made it again. This year it was earlier than usual so it made my day ![Smile](/images/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png).

I got renewed as an MVP for the next year for ASP.NET/IIS.

Congratulations to all the others who also got their renewal or did become an MVP for the first time.

Grz, Kris.
