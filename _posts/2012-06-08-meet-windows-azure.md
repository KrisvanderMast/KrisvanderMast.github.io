Yesterday evening, after giving a course about HTML 5 myself at Ordina, I drove to Microsoft Belgium to watch the announcements about Windows Azure. Scott Guthrie did a cool recap of all the new features and demoed these in all clarity. There’s a great load of new stuff shipping into Azure. Most notably the new IaaS and Windows Azure Web Sites. Besides that it became clear that the old Silverlight portal, which was pretty slow, has been put into the background and replaced by a great fresh and modern looking HTML 5 portal. Kudos to the design team behind it!

If you want to view the screencast again of what’s been announced be sure to check it out here: [http://www.meetwindowsazure.com/Conversations#ScottGuthrieMeet](/images/Conversations#ScottGuthrieMeet "http://www.meetwindowsazure.com/Conversations#ScottGuthrieMeet").

There was a really nice atmosphere at Microsoft Belgium as you can see:
