Likely due to some upgrade on my laptop but lately I've been seeing way more screens while <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> ing on Windows. Not annoying but still a load of screens to wade through when trying to find the one you're after while having a bunch of applications running.  

Turns out to be you can disable this. Simply follow these easy steps to make it work for you as well:

1. Open settings (shortcut <kbd>Winkey</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd>)
2. Click on __System__
3. Look for __Multitasking__ on the left part of the screen in the navigation
4. Select the setting you want from the dropdownlist under Alt+Tab
