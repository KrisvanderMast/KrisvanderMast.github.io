I’ve been giving presentations myself about this little handy tool from Microsoft and I’m happy to see that version 3 saw daylight and that I can finally speak about it as well. There are some very nice new features to it so be sure to check it out.

What to expect: [Cloud](/images/how-to-edit-a-site-hosted-on-windows-azure-with-webmatrix), [Git](/images/how-to-use-git-in-webmatrix), [TFS](/images/how-to-use-tfs-in-webmatrix).

Download it here: [http://www.microsoft.com/web/webmatrix/next/](/images/ "Microsoft WebMatrix 3").

Also [check out the WebCamps video where Vishal Joshi explains about all the new features in WebMatrix 3](/images/Vishal-Joshi-Introduces-WebMatrix-3 "Vishal Joshi Introduces WebMatrix 3").

Grz, Kris.
