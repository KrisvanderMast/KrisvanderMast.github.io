Next week, on June 23rd, there’s not only a new edition of the Belgian Community day. It’s also the fifth time it’s being held. A lot of Belgian, and this year also a Dutch, user groups are having several sessions. The agenda can be found here: [http://www.communityday.be/cd/tabid/130/Default.aspx](/images/Default.aspx "http://www.communityday.be/cd/tabid/130/Default.aspx"). And yes that’s right, my name’s also on the list ![Smile](/images/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png).

I’ll be presenting a session about moving existing applications to the cloud. I hope to see you there.
