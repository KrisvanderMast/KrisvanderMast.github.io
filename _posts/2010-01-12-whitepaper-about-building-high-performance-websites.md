While taking a look at the new Ajax library Microsoft put online I noticed at the bottom of a certain page a link to an interesting whitepaper: [Building high performance websites](/images/GetFile.aspx?Page=Building-High-Performance-Websites&File=Building%20High%20Performance%20Web%20Applications.pdf "Building high performance websites"). It’s an interesting read by [James Senior](/images/ "James Senior - Microsoft's social web guy") and [Dan Wahlin](/images/ "Dan Wahlin's weblog").

These are the main topics being discussed:

The Microsoft Ajax Content Delivery Network (/images/CDN) 
Loading ASP.NET Ajax Scripts 
Loading jQuery Scripts 
The ASP.NET Ajax Library Script Loader 
Using the ASP.NET Ajax Script LoaderLoading Custom 
Script Combining 
Using the Script Loader when Debugging 
Using the Script Loader's Lazy Loading Feature to increase performance 
JavaScript Application Performance Tools 
The Download Time Optimizer (/images/Doloto) 
Microsoft Ajax Minifier 
Internet Explorer JavaScript Profiler 
Internet Information Server 7 Compression and Caching Options

Grz, Kris.
