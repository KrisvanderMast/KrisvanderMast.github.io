You know how it goes, you’re coding “in the zone” and suddenly, poof, some error message. The culprit is that you have a localized version of the error message and your favorite search engine doesn’t really give you back some fancy hits to look for the golden answer. Bummer! However there’s hope for all facing this problem. This morning I came to know about an awesome online project to “unlocalize” error messages to English again: [http://unlocalize.com/](/images/ "http://unlocalize.com/").

Both .NET and SQL Server are in their portfolio and they also provide some handy plugins for different browsers like IE, Chrome and Firefox: [http://unlocalize.com/News.aspx](/images/News.aspx "http://unlocalize.com/News.aspx").

Be sure to give it a try.

Grz, Kris.
