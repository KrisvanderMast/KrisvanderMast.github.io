Aaaah, something to look forward to. The yearly Microsoft local techdays will be in Antwerp this year. Good for me as that city’s way nearer than all the other locations where they did it during the last year (/images/Ghent & Louvain laneuve). If you should attend it I’ll be there too so just come over and say hi.

Take a look at the official site: [http://www.microsoft.com/belux/techdays/about.aspx](/images/about.aspx "http://www.microsoft.com/belux/techdays/about.aspx").

Grz, Kris.
