Hi,

do you like to BUILD networks and hang out together with your peers and fellow tech loving friends? If that’s the case be sure to come over on October 30th to the Microsoft building in Zaventem and watch the BUILD live stream together. Please register over at [Microsoft BUILD 2012 Live stream event](/images/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032523670&Culture=en-us&community=0 "Microsoft BUILD 2012 Live stream event").

Grz, Kris.
