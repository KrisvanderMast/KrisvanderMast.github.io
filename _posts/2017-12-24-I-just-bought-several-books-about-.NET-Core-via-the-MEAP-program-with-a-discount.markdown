Due to the Christmas season and companies know that people already bought a lot of stuff for their loved ones they sometimes lower prices. Manning also does the same for their MEAP books and I bought two of them today.  

  - [Entity Framework Core in action][1]
  - [ASP.NET Core in action][2]

If you want to buy some books as well with a 50% discount you can make use of the following codes:  

- December 24th: dotd122417
- December 25th: dotd122517

Happy reading during the holidays!
