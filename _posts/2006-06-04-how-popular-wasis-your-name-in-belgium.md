While reading through the blogs I'm subscribed to, for the ones interested I use RSSBandit, I found these interesting links(/images/1) on the blog of [Smetty's Soapbox](/images/www.smetty.be).

On figure 1 you can clearly see that the forename **Kris** was quite popular in that time. On figure 2 you'll see that my last name **van der Mast** is most popular where I live. For the ones who know a bit about the geography of Belgium: I live in Essen which is at the top of the red colored part on the map.

**Figure 1**: Kris was quite a popular name when I was born in 1975.

**Figure 2**: van der Mast is most popular in the province of Antwerp.

Grz, Kris.
