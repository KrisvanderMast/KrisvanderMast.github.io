Well, just after last week SQL Server 2008 was released, SP1 for Visual Studio 2008 came out today. Normally a service pack only contains some patches but this time there's a lot of extra added features inside the package. The things I'm most looking forward to are these: 
 

* ADO.NET Entity framework
* ADO.NET Data Services
* Classic ASP support in Visual Studio.
* ASP.NET Dynamic Data
* ...

I noticed the links on the MSDN subscription pages and you can also [download the goods here](/images/cc533448.aspx). 
 
[Here](/images/cc533447.aspx) you can read more about what's inside. 
 
Grz, Kris.
