A couple of weeks Visual Studio 2017 was released to the public. If you want to see the announcements and keynotes be sure to navigate to https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Visual-Studio/Visual-Studio-2017-Launch/100.  

Something I found pretty cool was that this time there was also a free poster which you can download here which provides you with an overview of all the new stuff they put in in VS and the languages. Nicely done.  

Thereâ€™s also a bunch of small intro and overview videos of the new features: https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Visual-Studio/Visual-Studio-2017-Launch.  

Be sure to also check out the newest sample application provided by Microsoft: BikeSharing360. You can find the code on github:
