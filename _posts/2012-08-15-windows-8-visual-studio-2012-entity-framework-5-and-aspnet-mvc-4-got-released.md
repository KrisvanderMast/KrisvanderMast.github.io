Ok, so today felt a bit like Christmas in summer. In case you didn’t know already Microsoft released it’s much anticipated [Windows 8 on MSDN](/images/ "Microsoft Windows 8 MSDN subscription download").

Not only that but also [Visual Studio 2012](/images/ "Visual Studio 2012") got released today so this guy’s a happy developer once more.

And Because Microsoft likes to hand out good stuff they also released [Entity Framework 5](/images/ef5-released.aspx "Entity Framework 5"), [ASP.NET MVC 4 and Web API](/images/mvc4 "ASP.NET MVC 4 and Web API"), …

Of course popular things couldn’t stay behind. Mads Kristensen released the new [Web Essentials for VS2012](/images/Web-Essentials-2012-released.aspx "Web Essentials for VS2012") and [Orchard can be proud to say to be the first CMS to be released with ASP.NET MVC 4](/images/5d1da6c35ace "Orchard CMS").

I’m convinced more tools, open source frameworks building on these awesome things will find their way the coming days and weeks. So stay tuned!

So, too much too handle on a way too hot and humid night but there’s a weekend coming to test spin this stuff all around.

Grz, Kris.
