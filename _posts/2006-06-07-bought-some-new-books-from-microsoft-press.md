Thanks to the newly added service by Microsoft in Belgium, I was told that this service was already longer available for other countries, called MSDN Connection one can purchase every month a book of the month at a 40% discount. Today I bought those of May and June:

The weather's finally getting better in Belgium so I can relax and read some interesting stuff the next couple of weeks.

Grz, Kris.
