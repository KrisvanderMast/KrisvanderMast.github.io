One of the nice things when you gather with a bunch of tech minded people like yourself (/images/MicrosoftVIPCommunityOffsite2007.aspx)) is that you get to know urls to interesting tech stuff. Apparently already very known, except by me are the [MSDN UK nuggets](/images/default.aspx). Some small, interesting videos that highlight a specific topic in 10-15 minutes. I sure do like the idea as most webcasts are too long or they want to cover as much as possible in an as short as possible time span with as endresult that nobody gets the message.

Another one that I found related to that, and one that seems very new so most of my tech savvy friends don't know about it untill when they read my blog is this [Nibbles site](/images/www.nibblestutorials.net). It seems to only have some tutorials at the moment, especially focussed on Blend and Silverlight/WPF. As I'm keen on learning both I'll sure be checking this one out.

Grz, Kris.
