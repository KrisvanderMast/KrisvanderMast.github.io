IIS7 hasn't shipped yet but will be available in Vista and Longhorn server. It provides better ways to extend it and configure it. There's also already some nice video content about the subject:

* [How developers can extend IIS7](/images/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=215282)* [Installing IIS7 on Windows Vista](/images/Showpost.aspx?postid=206237)* [The .NET show: IIS7](/images/manifest.xml)

Microsoft also provides the possibility to [test drive it on one of their Virtual Labs](/images/iisnet).

Grz, Kris.
