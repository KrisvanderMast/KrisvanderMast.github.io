You can listen to the podcast from [Hanselminutes.com](/images/ "Hanselminutes.com"). [Podcast 37](/images/hanselminutes_0037.mp3) is an interview with [Scott Guthrie](/images/scottgu "Weblog Scott Guthrie").

Also Dino Esposito was busy writing about/teaching ASP.NET AJAX. This resulted in an upcoming book called Introducing ASP.NET 2.0 AJAX Extensions. Best of all, [you can download a free chapter of it here](/images/atlas-book.aspx).

The TOC of the upcoming book:

- Building Blocks of Ajax-style Web Applications- Building Blocks of the Atlas Application Framework- Updatable Page Fragments- Atlas Control Toolbox & Behaviors- The Atlas Client Library- Web Services- Client-side Data Binding- Atlas Gadgets

 I can only hope that the final book will cover the updated Microsoft AJAX bits since last week the Beta 1 was released and I already saw on the [ASP.NET forums](/images/forums.asp.net), where [I'm a moderator and top 10 poster](/images/XIII.aspx "XIII"), that a lot of threads are added with questions/problems about the new bits as there seems to be a lot of changes since the CTP releases.

 Grz, Kris.
