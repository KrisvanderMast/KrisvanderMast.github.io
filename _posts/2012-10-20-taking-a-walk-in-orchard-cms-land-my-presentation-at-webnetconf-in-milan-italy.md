Today I gave a presentation in Milan, Italy at [WebNetConf](/images/ "WebNetConf"). The atmosphere was great and there was a big audience and almost no no-show which is great.

The talk itself was the last one of the day and you can see I was very much focused:

I really enjoyed the day, the interaction, the sushi and pizza they served during noon and the simply the whole event. I got to know people from all over the world as 11 nationalities were represented and there was quite a lot of interaction which I find great.

The presentation itself had the following description:

Orchard CMS, distilled in the secret laboratories at Microsoft but later on open sourced, is a great way to start building sites with a CMS topping. This session will show you how to set it up, create custom modules and put it on Windows Azure with a little help of WebMatrix.

Update: I got to know that my sessions scored a 4.5 / 5. Cool!
