Today I’ve spent some time on getting the first pages right for a new site. Since 2006 I’ve only had a blog but no particular pages handy on my site. Due to demand by people I decided to take this part up and already crafted several pages:

* [Landing page](/images/ "Index")
* [About](/images/About.html "About page")
* [Downloads](/images/downloads.html "Downloads page")

Today these are still simple html but I want to switch to a full blown CMS system soon. The one that I have in mind is [Orchard](/images/ "Orchard CMS").

The pages themselves are made up with some small CSS 3 enhancements and HTML 5 semantics in mind. I based it on the [Mango theme](/images/Orchard.Theme.Mango "Orchard CMS Mango theme") people can download for Orchard. Actually I started up WebMatrix, grabbed Orchard from the gallery, set up a site and took the aforementioned Mango theme. Then simply creating a couple of pages and in the browser save these as html. Then took [Sublime 2](/images/sublime-text-2-beta "Sublime 2") to change some paths to some scripts. Uploaded and voila, one happy camper ![Smile](/images/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png).

Grz, Kris.
