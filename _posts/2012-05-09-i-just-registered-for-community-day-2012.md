It’s becoming one of those yearly traditions in Belgium: rainy weather, great beers, … and since the last years also the yearly [Community Day](/images/ "Community Day 2012 Belgium"). This year there will be 40 sessions in total with 6 tracks! I’ll be there as well and hope to see a lot of community people. Azug, the user group of which I’m a board member will also be doing several sessions.

Grz, Kris.
