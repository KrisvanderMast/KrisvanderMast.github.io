Since I shifted to another project/client I'm constantly using my laptop so I decided to "upgrade" my user experience while developing by making it easier to type on a normal keyboard and to have my screen in a decent position instead of constantly looking down. So I decided to buy a [Logitech Alto](/images/details&CONTENTID=12343&countryid=19&languageid=1 "Logitech Alto").

I like the soft keyboard and the integrated USB hub to plug my mouse in (/images/a Logitech MX 1000 laser btw). I only had the pleasure to work with it for a single day but I already like it a lot.
