If you are into web development you know there are a bunch of tools out there to make your life easier while concentrating on the things you want or need to focus on. One of these tools is gulp.js. It is an easy one to start with though and it is supported in Visual Studio.If you like a good read and want to get up to speed with gulp fast or already have experience but just want interesting code samples you can download this free ebook at [Syncfusion.com](/images/Gulp_Succinctly).

The name of the writer of this particular book should ring familiar: Kris van der Mast. Yes indeed, that’s me ![Smile](/images/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png).

I made up a contract to write another book about Azure Web Jobs and I hope to have it ready by end of this year.

Grz, Kris.
