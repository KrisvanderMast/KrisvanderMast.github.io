Your business, your fame. That’s the title of the new Belgian Microsoft contest. It’s a great opportunity for you to learn to work with Azure, put your company in the spotlights and win! There are some cool prizes, besides eternal fame, to win.

The link where the big adventure can begin for you is: [http://yourbusinessyourfame.cloudapp.net/](/images/ "Your business. Your fame. A Belgian Windows Azure contest."). Good luck!

Grz, Kris.
