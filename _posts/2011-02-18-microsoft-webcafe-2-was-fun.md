Yesterday I attended the second edition of Microsoft WebCafe. A social get together with tech people hosted by Microsoft and each time at a different location. This time it was at the offices of Combell, an important player in the hosting market.

After a very friendly welcome, and good catering, it was first a social interacting time. Then during a half hour 3 short sessions passed by which were about several topics:

* Scaling in the cloud
* mijnTVgids, an application for different mobile devices
* Discovering interesting people at Microsoft Belgium

Then a break of about another half hour with social interaction and another 3 sessions:

* iRail Windows Phone 7 application
* Umbraco, a short introduction
* 10 minutes to discover Microsoft Web apps & tools

I got to know new people, had fun and got some nice and short demos. An evening well spent and I’m already looking forward going to the next edition.

Grz, Kris.
