My collegue and I arrived in Barcelona after a flight of about 2 hours. The registration went smoothly and I'm really looking forward to the sessions that'll start tomorrow. The hotel itself, in the center of the city Barcolona, is new since the beginning of this year and is quite comfortable. The internet connection however in the hotel is a bit slow but it can keep up with my typing ;-). The weather is also a lot better than in Belgium so the next thing we'll be doing is to take a peek in what Barcolena has to offer.

Grz, Kris.
