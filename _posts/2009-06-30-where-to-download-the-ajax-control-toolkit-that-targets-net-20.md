Strange but true but this is a question that I notice a lot on [forums.asp.net](/images/forums.asp.net). Normally the latest and most up to date version can be found at <http://ajaxcontroltoolkit.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=27326> like I described in one of my [former blog posts](/images/NewVersionOfTheASPNETAJAXControlToolkit.aspx).

How great [Codeplex](/images/www.codeplex.com) may be it seems that it’s difficult for a lot of people to find the correct version that targets ASP.NET 2.0. If you’re one of these people whose looking for it then navigate to this url: <http://www.codeplex.com/AjaxControlToolkit/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=11121>. As you can see there haven’t been updates out anymore for .NET 2.0 since February 29th 2008.

Update: apparently I already blogged about this in the past: [ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit only for 3.5 anymore?](/images/ASPNETAJAXControlToolkitOnlyFor35Anymore.aspx) Seems to me like still not a lot of people can find it.

Grz, Kris.
