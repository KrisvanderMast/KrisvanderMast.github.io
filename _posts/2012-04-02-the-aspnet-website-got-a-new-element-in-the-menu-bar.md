I just noticed that the ASP.NET website has gotten a small but very interesting upgrade. Until recently it was somewhat hard to find the information about Web API and Single Page Applications (/images/SPA). As the menu was already pretty crowded the site now has an extra menu called **Solutions**. From there on one can easily find all the major technology stacks with references to tutorials, videos, samples, …
