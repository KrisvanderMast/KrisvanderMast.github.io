I already knew Jeff's a great speaker after I saw him deliver a session last year at TechEd in Barcelona. Today I had the pleasure to see him at work again at the pre conference day about ASP.NET 2.0, ASP.NET AJAX (/images/server & client side) and the upcoming technology WPF/e. I also had the pleasure of talking briefly directly to Jeff during the break. Seems like a nice person to me.

The most interesting session for me was the one in the afternoon which was about the client side part, also known as the Microsoft AJAX Library. I did a presentation myself so I already experimented with the technology but didn't take a look at the Futures CTP which was also highlighted.

We also got to know that WPF/e will get a name change at MIX07 next month and that several things will be changing for the better. What it'll be we have to wait for because that's still under NDA but I'm looking forward to get my hands dirty on that new technology.

Jeff is going to give other presentations on the dev & IT pro days so if you have the chance of attending one of those sessions, do so.

Something else I really like attending those conferences is the have the chance to meet up with former collegues, people I know when I was just studying to become an engineer, former teachers, people I know from the online community but seldomly see in real life. It's nice to team up, get to know what others are doing for interesting projects etc.

Grz, Kris.
