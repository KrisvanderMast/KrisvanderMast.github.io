I'm probably very late with this but finally decided to join [**del.icio.us**](/images/KvdM) so finally people can also see what I like to read or am interested in.

For people who don't know this service:

**del.icio.us is a collection of favorites** - yours and everyone else's. Use del.icio.us to:

* **Keep** links to your favorite articles, blogs, music, restaurant reviews, and more on del.icio.us and access them from any computer on the web.* **Share** favorites with friends, family, and colleagues.* **Discover** new things. Everything on del.icio.us is someone's favorite - they've already done the work of finding it. Explore and enjoy.

Grz, Kris.
