Just received this by email from my collegue [Jean-Christophe](/images/jcgregoire) at my current client [BICS](/images/www.belgacom-ics.com). Apparently one of my MVP colleagues set up a wiki for LINQ related technology. If you want to take a look at it you can navigate to [Hooked on LINQ](/images/MainPage.ashx). 
 
This is a nice addition to my earlier post: [101 LINQ to SQL samples](/images/101LINQToSQLSamples.aspx). I guess we all know what to do during the coming holidays... 
 
Grz, Kris.
