I got reawarded as an MVP for my continued volunteering work in the Azure space.  
Today was a day that all MVP's in the world got to know if they were renewed or not so it is a very exciting moment worldwide for a good 3800 people. It's great to see your friends got renewed as well and saddening to see some didn't make it anymore.  

How to become one yourself? Take a look at [How to become an MVP](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/pages/what-it-takes-to-be-an-mvp).
