Last week I reported on this very blog that I got renewed again as an MVP. Today I got the official box with the award in it and I noticed that I’m no longer an ASP.NET MVP. That was expected as the titles have changed a bit with the internal changes at Microsoft. I’m now happy to announce that I’m an MVP in two categories:

* Microsoft Azure
* Visual Studio and Development technologies

Grz, Kris.
