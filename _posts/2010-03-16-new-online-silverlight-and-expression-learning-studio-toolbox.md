Microsoft launched [.toolbox](/images/default.aspx "Toolbox"), a new site dedicated on learning Silverlight and Expression.

[![toolbox](/images/toolbox_3.jpg "toolbox")](/images/default.aspx)

*.toolbox features two core learning paths: Design Scenarios and Design Principles. Both begin with teaching basic techniques and build skills and knowledge incrementally. In **Design Scenarios**, designers and developers learn to create dynamically-rich Silverlight applications using Expression Studio. You will learn to add code-free functionality to designs by following step-by-step tutorials that illustrate how to create interactive user experiences. In **Design Principles**, you will learn fundamental design concepts (/images/e.g., choosing the right colors and the right fonts) along with tips and techniques in how to apply them to your creations.*

One can go for either track and earn leves with that. Each track can be done one by one following a stack or go through the matrix:
