Today I was in Poland for the annual Azure Day Poland. A great gathering of (inter)national speakers about Microsoft Azure technology in the beautiful city of Warsaw.  

The presentation I gave was about _a revisit to the Azure App Service_. A great service which I've been using for several years now. Going through my [past presentations](/talks-presentations) of years ago I can see I already provided sessions about this particular subject at different conferences and even at my former university.  

Why I think it's such a great service? It's a low entry step towards the cloud, easy to use, powerfull, there's a Linux and Windows variant, staging slots, integration with different source control systems like Github, bitbucket or Azure DevOps, ...

Some images from the presentation itself:
