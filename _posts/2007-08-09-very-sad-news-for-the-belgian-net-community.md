I [just read the sad news about the death of a great .NET community person](/images/david.aspx): David Boschmans. I knew David as being a great and nice guy that took the time to listen to the community. I heard at the [VIP community weekend](/images/MicrosoftVIPCommunityOffsite2007.aspx) that he had health problems but that he was recovering. Rest in peace good man, you'll be missed.

Grz, Kris.
