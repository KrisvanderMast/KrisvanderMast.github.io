Yesterday I attended the meeting of Visug, a Belgian user group of which I'm a member, with as meetings subject Exception handling and logging. It wasn't a traditional way of presenting but was more like an open discussion which became quite lively at moments. Especially when we reached the stage of discussing the differences between logging and auditing.

It was very interesting to hear different oppinions because of the mixed audiance: architects, developers and even an IT pro who wanted to learn more about .NET and see what the impact could be to the servers he maintains.

I'm already looking forward to the Geek Dinner next week in Antwerp with the fellow members of Visug. If you want more information you can [take a look at the site.](/images/ "VISUG")

Grz, Kris.
