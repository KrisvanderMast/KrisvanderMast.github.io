[Somasegar blogged about it](/images/silverlight-the-next-generation-web-media-experiences.aspx "Somasegar Silverlight"). Finally the new name of WPF/e is known and it's Silverlight. I still have to get used to the new name but think it's better this way because it makes it easier to understand for less technical people that it was little to do with WPF. Microsofts hope is of course that it'll be a Flash killer but they have quite some downloads to go. But on the other hand I hope more games will be coming out soon like these: [WPF/e games](/images/WPFeGames.aspx). Of course it'll be Silverlight games then.

[You can also see a small video about it on10](/images/out-with-wpfe-in-with-microsoft-silverlight-this-has-just-been-announced).
