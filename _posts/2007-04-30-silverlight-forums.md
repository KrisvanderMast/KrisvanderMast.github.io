The Silverlight forums, where I'll also be playing a moderation role, just went live. Go check them out! Of course there's not only the forums but also a [getting started part](/images/GetStarted), a learn section where [already several videos are available](/images/learnvideos.aspx). [Whitepapers](/images/whitepapers.aspx) and [quickstarts](/images/quickstarts) are also available.

Grz, Kris.
