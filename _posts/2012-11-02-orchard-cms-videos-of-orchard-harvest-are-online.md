I couldn’t attend [Orchard Harvest](/images/agenda "Orchard Harvest") myself unfortunately however more and more of the recordings are coming online for us to watch:

### Day 2

I do hope that the rest of the videos come online soon as well.

Btw, in case you didn’t know it yet, Orchard 1.6 recently came out. You can download the source from [Codeplex](/images/ "Orchard CMS on Codeplex") or get a running site via [WebPI](/images/platform.aspx "Web Platform Installer") or [WebMatrix](/images/ "WebMatrix").

Grz, Kris.
