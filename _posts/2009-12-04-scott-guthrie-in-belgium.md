Yesterda I went to Kinepolis in Brussels for what was going to be a great afternoon. [Scott Guthrie](/images/scottgu "Scott Guthrie") doesn’t come every year to Belgium, actually it was its second time, so when he does you better be there to hear what he’s talking about.

The guys from [Visug](/images/ "Visug Belgium") did a great job preparing the event and had prepared a little fun ingredient for Scott. Everybody got to wear red polo shirts:

The session itself covered the following topics:

* [ASP.NET 4.0](/images/ "ASP.NET") and Visual studio 2010
* [Silverlight 4](/images/www.silverlight.net "Silverlight 4")
* [ASP.NET MVC 2](/images/ "ASP.NET MVC")

For me personally it was a great opportunity to see and talk with Scott again after the last MVP summit and there was some pretty interesting content about web related technologies (/images/my favorite). Microsoft’s really doing a great job for webdevelopers with brining out new tools, new little additions to a more maturing web platform (/images/ASP.NET 4.0), investing in new ways to let developers develop close to the raw metal with MVC and making it possible for them to create compelling applications with Silverlight.

One of the nice intros about Silverlight is its streaming capabilities with a cool pixar style animation: [http://www.iis.net/media/experiencesmoothstreaming](/images/experiencesmoothstreaming "Silverlight smooth streaming demo").

Grz, Kris.
