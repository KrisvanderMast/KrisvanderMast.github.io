I'm probably one of the last blogging about this but Atlas, the AJAX framework by Microsft, is going to be renamed. Also other good news: they'll do their best to ship a version 1.0, which will be supported, this year. Now we only get to get used to the new names:

* **Microsoft AJAX Library**: The client-side JavaScript library (/images/i.e., all the .js files) that works with any browser and also supports any server-side framework, not just ASP.NET.* **ASP.NET 2.0 AJAX Extensions**: The server-side functionality that seamlessly integrates with ASP.NET and uses the same programming model familiar to existing ASP.NET developers.* **ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit**: The set of free, shared source controls and components that currently form the ["Atlas" Control Toolkit](/images/View.aspx?ProjectName=AtlasControlToolkit) community project hosted on [CodePlex](/images/www.codeplex.com).* **Microsoft AJAX** = **Microsoft AJAX Library** + **ASP.NET 2.0 AJAX Extensions**.

You can read more about it on the blogs of [Scott Guthrie](/images/_2200_Atlas_2200_-1.0-Naming-and-Roadmap.aspx), [Brian Goldfarb](/images/749691.aspx) & [Keith Smith](/images/749773.aspx).

Grz, Kris.
