A couple of weeks ago I decided to buy these 2 books at Amazon. They arrived today by mail though the initial mail from Amazon stated that the expected date of arrival would probably be December 4th. Luckily for me they came sooner.

I didn't had much time to read in them and since it's the first time that I bought a book from Manning or Sitepoint I'll get to get used to their style I guess. Now I have something new to read on the train after finishing the 5th book in the *increasingly inaccurately named trilogy of five of The Hitch Hiker's guide to galaxy*. Talking about the train: I spend nowadays more than 3 hours per day for getting to my work and back. I hope my next project's nearer and has something to do with ASP.NET 3.5, AJAX, Silverlight, ...

Grz, Kris.
