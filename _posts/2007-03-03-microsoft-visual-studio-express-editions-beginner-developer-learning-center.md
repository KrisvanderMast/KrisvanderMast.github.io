Microsoft provides since recently a new learning center for the beginning developer. Totally dedicated to the freely available Expression editions of Visual Studio 2005 people who are interested in beginning to learn to program can take advantage of.

[You can find the Learning Center here](/images/default.aspx "Microsoft Visual Studio Express Editions Beginner Developer Learning Center").

Another interesting piece of information are the [SQL Server 2005 Express For Beginners screencasts](/images/default.aspx?tabid=63#sql "SQL Server 2005 For Beginners").

Grz, Kris.
