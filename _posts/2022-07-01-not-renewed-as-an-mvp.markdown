Today I got notified that I didn't make it for another year as an MVP... That left me with a pretty hollow feeling at first as I've been an MVP for 16 years now. But after a while I realized that I'm not going to stop being active in the community. I'm still going to blog, speak at events, help people out on StackOverflow, ... I'm still going to be active in the community, just not as an MVP anymore.  

I want to thank Microsoft for all the opportunities they gave me over the years. I've been able to meet so many great people, and I've learned so much. I'm really grateful for that. I have great memories of the MVP summits or other events where I could meet up with other MVPs. I'm going to miss that.  

It was not only a bit shocking to me but also to many people in the (Belgian) community as I'm seen as a very active person in the community. Don't worry, I won't be stopping that

Covid-19, less virtual [azug](https://www.azug.be/) events and besides my day to day work combining a thesis for my post graduate studies at KUL university, didn't really play in my favor.

From the feedback provided by Microsoft it was this time rather difficult to put me into one of the MVP categories as I've been active in so many different areas: Power Virtual Agents, Azure, .NET development, Python development, helping out a PhD researcher with learning out to program in Python and Pytorch, ...

Either way, I'm sure after a couple of days I'll be back to my usual self and I'll be back to being active in the community. I'm already busy with the preparations of our next big event [CloudBrew 2022](https://www.cloudbrew.be/2022/). It's going to be a great event, so make sure to register for it. See you there!
