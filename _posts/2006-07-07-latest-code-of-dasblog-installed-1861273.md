I just installed the latest binaries of dasBlog. If you like to know how to get the latest source code yourself I like to point out to this excellent post: [Re-Post of "Compiling the DasBlog Source Code" from DasBlog.info](/images/RePost+Of+Compiling+The+DasBlog+Source+Code+From+DasBloginfo.aspx). Also be sure to use the package.bat file at the root of the downloaded bits because publishing, using vs.net 2005, doesn't seem to work out that very well.

I also created several macros, a great feature to have IMHO, of which you can see the result in every post at the bottom. I include links to email, add to delicious, digg or technorati. It's my plan to create an article about this soon.

Grz, Kris.
