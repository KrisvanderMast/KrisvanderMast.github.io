Today I gave another Webcamps session at Microsoft HQ in Brussels Belgium. A nice bunch of people and I had a small surprise for them later on the day… Microsoft chose this day to celebrate the fact that Internet explorer 6, the quite old browser, had gotten under 1% usage in Belgium. Something to celebrate! So we were presented a very, very tasty pie with a nice message on it:

In case you didn’t know it yet, Microsoft provides a dedicated site which keeps track of the usage of IE6: [http://www.ie6countdown.com/](/images/ "Internet explorer 6 countdown"). On that site you can also [find a small snippet to add to your site](/images/join-us.aspx "IE6 countdown snippet") to promote people visiting yours to simply install a better browser. Note: Internet explorer 10 will be around (/images/and hopefully soon). I have been playing with the preview bits already and I must say, it looks very good. More speed, better HTML 5 support, increased security, …

In case you want to know, yes the pie tasted really great.

Grz, Kris.
