Since WPF and especially Silverlight, since version 3 recently was released, have similarities it’s nice to have an overview of what both technologies have to offer and where Silverlight’s left out on certain things. I found such an overview on Codeplex: [http://wpfslguidance.codeplex.com/](/images/ "http://wpfslguidance.codeplex.com/").

Taken from the project description:

*WPF and Silverlight are both XAML based platforms but there are some important functionality and implementation differences between the two. This project contains content illustrating these differences and the best practices for developing against these platforms. 
Content posted to this project includes a whitepaper detailing what is similar and different between the two platforms as well as how to code against both platforms getting as much code reuse as possible.*

Grz, Kris.
