Yesterday evening I started the installer but it really got stuck. Bummer. But luckily there's a [thriving forum](/images/forums.asp.net) to ask questions. The answer I got was to first install the .NET 3.5 framework first which can be found on the DVD under the WCU folder.

If you should also get into trouble while installing, I really hope not, you can also try out this approach.

Grz, Kris.
