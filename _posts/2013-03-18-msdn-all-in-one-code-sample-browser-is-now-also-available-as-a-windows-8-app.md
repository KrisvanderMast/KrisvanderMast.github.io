Since several years Microsoft helpers have created the All in One Code overview filled with samples & search possibilities for those common scenarios they saw being asked for over and over again on forums or newsgroups. It’s cool to see it has now also become a [Windows 8 Store App](/images/6fd83c79-a2fc-4887-9284-535681eb3993).
