I got renewed as an MVP for ASP.NET. I’ve been renewed every year since 2007 when I first got the award.

I’ll keep doing my best for the community for the next year(/images/s) to come as well. Being an MVP is all about community work and interaction and I really love that community. Thanks to that I got to know a lot of interesting people, became a better developer and person. It’s been an awesome ride so far.

Grz, Kris.
