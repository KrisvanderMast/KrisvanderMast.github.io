Hmm, I hope the marketing guys of Microsoft aren't going to keep renaming Atlas. I already found it hard enough to not speak about Atlas anymore but of Microsoft AJAX. Seems it's renamed again. [Read my former post about the renaming of Atlas](/images/default.aspx#aa8062dc7-4920-4c91-968c-0e2076660b93).

Here's the new naming for the moment:

- **Microsoft AJAX Library**: The client-side Javascript library (/images/i.e., all the .js files) that works with any browser and also supports any server-side framework, not just ASP.NET.- **ASP.NET 2.0 AJAX Extensions**: The server-side functionality that seamlessly integrates with ASP.NET and uses the same programming model familiar to existing ASP.NET developers.- **ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit**: The set of free, shared source controls and components that currently form the ["Atlas" Control Toolkit](/images/View.aspx?ProjectName=AtlasControlToolkit) community project hosted on [CodePlex](/images/www.codeplex.com).- **ASP.NET AJAX** = **Microsoft AJAX Library** + **ASP.NET 2.0 AJAX Extensions**.

 Grz, Kris.
