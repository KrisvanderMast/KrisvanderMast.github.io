Yesterday evening I attended an MSDN event in Utopolis Mechelen dedicated to Silverlight. Not a really deep dive technical session and you could tell by seeing quite a lot of designer in the audience as well. [Tom Mertens](/images/tommer) did a little keynote about the different versions of Expression Studio and where to locate and [Gill Cleeren](/images/www.snowball.be) presented the session. It was very interesting though not very technical but a nice showcase of what's possible with it and which products one can use to visually create stunning RIAs (/images/Rich Interactive Applications).

Afterwards it was a nice gathering in the Movie Café. Nice because I had the chance to see some familiar faces that I haven't seen in years. Afterwards several people hooked up together to get something to eat in La Fleche. They served quite a good lasagne. A very nice evening: some tech stuff, good food, nice company to talk with.

Grz, Kris.
