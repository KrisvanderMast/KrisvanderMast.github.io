This year I went again to the MVP summit in Redmond and Belle Vue. I had a blast to see so many familiar faces again, get to know many more people and having lots of interactions and networking. The technical sessions were interesting but the most awesome times were the after hours meetups. As I got awarded as MVP of the year this year I also got the opportunity to go out on a nice dinner with several other MVPs holding that title and several high ranking managers at Microsoft. The day after I also met up with people from the TFS online group and several program managers of the Windows Azure Web Sites group. It was very nice to interact and provide feedback.

On the last day we also tried to gather as many of the ASP Insiders as possible and have a cool picture of the gang ![Smile](/images/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png). I’m the third person from the left with the green sweater.

Of course I hope to be there again next year as well ![Smile](/images/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png).

Grz, Kris.
