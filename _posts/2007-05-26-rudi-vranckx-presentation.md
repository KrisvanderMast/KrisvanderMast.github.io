Yesterday evening I attended a presentation by the Flemish conflict reporter Rudi Vranckx who's the guy that has massive knowledge about the Middle East. He just got back from Israel was is probably right getting ready to fly to Lebanon. He talked about his insights he gained through 18 years of reporting about the conflicts and it was very interesting. One of the reasons why I attended this presentation was because I know an MVP and collegue ASP.NET forums moderator who lives there.

The presentation was honest and the video material was mostly about the normal average day people out there that suffer from this ongoing conflicts. Rudi himself developed a high sympathy for a certain doctor in Irak who's trying to do research on the increasing rate of cancer patients and uranium enriched weaponry that was used during the Gulf War.

Grz, Kris.
