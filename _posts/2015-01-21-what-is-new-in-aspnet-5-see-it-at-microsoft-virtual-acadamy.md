Likely somewhere this year [ASP.NET 5, or vNext](/images/ "ASP.NET 5") as it’s been called in the past, will launch. From all we hear each time it’s going to be a major shift again, likely as big as the shift from classic ASP to ASP.NET back in 2002. To get to know what’s going to change the people from the ASP.NET team made a series of screencasts available for us. You can watch them at your convenience at [Microsoft Virtual Academy](/images/ "Microsoft Virtual Academy").

Go sit in your comfy chair and take some time to watch it at [http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/what-s-new-with-asp-net-5](/images/what-s-new-with-asp-net-5 "What's new with ASP.NET 5").

Grz, Kris.
