Today is a bit of a special day for me. I started exactly 10 years ago on a professional level with [ASP.NET](/images/www.asp.net "ASP.NET"). I has given me quite an interesting journey and quite a lot of interesting projects to work on with other dedicated people with whom I could exchange views and insights.

Another mark is that I started the same day, thanks to the mentioning of a consultant who told me about its existence, I started on the [ASP.NET forums](/images/forums.asp.net). In the beginning only either lurking for information or simply to ask questions when I got stuck with something. I remember that after a while I was looking through some posts and noticed I knew the answer to one of them. I replied and a got a huge thank you!! back from the person who started the thread. Since then I’ve been trying to answer more and more question with the end result being that after 10 years I’m the number one recognition points holder: <http://www.asp.net/community/recognition/hall-of-fame>.

It’s been quite a remarkable and exciting time during those years and I loved it! The coming years will I not only continue to invest in ASP.NET, the forums, the (/images/Belgian) community but also in something that inspires me and in which I believe: cloud computing, so be sure to see more blog posts about that topic as well around here.

Grz, Kris.
