Yesterday the EBC badminton club, of which I'm a member and former board member, organised its annual championship. Normally I would rank very low because I, together with my usual partner, are the only recreational players. But yesterday I even got to the cross finals! Some games were real thrillers. The most important things: I had a lot of fun playing, learned some new tricks while playing against people who were by far better than me and I also noticed that I'm getting better at my own game.
