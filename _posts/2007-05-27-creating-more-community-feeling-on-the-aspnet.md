Since recently the ASP.NET forums got an upgrade to the new Community Server 2007 there's also the possibility to show your Fans and Friends. Not really much at the moment since the feature's a little unknown by most members at this moment and you have to enable some parts in your Profile.

If you're a member reading this you can enable it by clicking on the **Edit Profile** button in the right upper corner, navigate to the **Favorites tab** and check the **Share Friends** checkbox and hit save at the bottom of that page. After that it's easy to add friends by going to their public profile of a member you see on the forums or, if you know their nickname, navigate directly to http://forums.asp.net/members/***nickname***.aspx. So for me that becomes <http://forums.asp.net/members/XIII.aspx>.

Then click the Add as friend link and go back to your public profile and voila, the person appears in your friends list.
