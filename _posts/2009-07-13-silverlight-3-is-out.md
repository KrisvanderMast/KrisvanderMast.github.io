Going on vacation to Greece without pc or internet connection (/images/but in very good company) is nice but you always find when coming home that new cool things have arrived. This time it turned out to be the long awaited [Silverlight 3](/images/www.silverlight.net).

There’s an [interesting video on Channel 9 with Scott Guthrie](/images/Scott-Guthrie-Silverlight-3-is-here) on the new things that shipped and also a new [dedicated site](/images/default.html). Be sure to check these out.

With the new version there’s also need of a tool to build compelling RIAs with. This is still in Release candidate but you can already [check out Blend 3](/images/dd565875.aspx).

Grz, Kris.
