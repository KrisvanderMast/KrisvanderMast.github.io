It's MIX and that always means great stuff coming to web developers. This year it's the [ASP.NET MVC Preview 2](/images/details.aspx?familyid=38cc4cf1-773a-47e1-8125-ba3369bf54a3&displaylang=en&tm) and [Silverlight 2](/images/installationfiles.aspx?v=2.0). Great times are ahead of us.

Grz, Kris.
