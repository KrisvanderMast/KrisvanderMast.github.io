Our every day IDE of choice, Visual Studio, is a nice tool. I already know quite a lot of keyboard shortcuts and how to handle the IDE myself but [this blog has quite a lot of handy tips](/images/saraford). And today's tip's [how to reach the navigation bar via the keyboard](/images/did-you-know-how-to-reach-the-navigation-bar-via-the-keyboard.aspx). One keyboard shortcut I was still craving for.

Grz, Kris.
