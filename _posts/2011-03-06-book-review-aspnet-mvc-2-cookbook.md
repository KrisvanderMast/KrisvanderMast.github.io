A couple of weeks ago I found a new shiny book in my mailbox: **[ASP.NET MVC2 Cookbook](/images/book "ASP.NET MVC2 Cookbook")** by Andrew Siemer and Richard Kimber. Due to a very busy schedule at work and the 2011 MVP summit in Seattle it took me a bit of time to go through it completely.

First of all, I like the cookbook approach that Packt’s been using for some time now. These books show off small examples that are reusable in most occasions of day to day development. This book is for sure no exclusion on that part so I liked it. The benefit of having short, spread over several pages, recipes is that you can simply read it when needed or go through them if you don’t have much time in a one by one fashion.

The book itself is clearly written and divided in several chapters which not only covers MVC but also topics like data storage. What I found to be great is that it also introduces tools like [Automapper](/images/ "Automapper"), [NBuilder](/images/ "NBuilder"), [MvcContrib](/images/ "MvcContrib"), [MvcSitemap](/images/ "MvcSitemap"), … and also makes the reader used to things like [Dependency injection](/images/Dependency_injection "Dependency injection") (/images/ "Structuremap")) and for example the [PRG pattern](/images/Get "PRG pattern") (/images/Get), Hijaxing (/images/Progressive_enhancement "Progressive enhancement") or [graceful degradation](/images/Graceful_degradation "Graceful degradation")).

Are there downsides on this book? Well, yes. First of all it’s not for people who just want to start with ASP.NET MVC. Some being used to the technology basics will surely help to grasp this book. I would suggest making [Nerddinner](/images/ "Nerddinner") or [MVC Music Store](/images/ "MVC Music Store"), both free tutorials with guiding eBook, is a must. Second is the fact that it was published a month too soon. Why? Just before this book got released Microsoft unleashed ASP.NET MVC 3 to the world. It would’ve been great if some recipes would’ve included some MVC 3 juice too. Not everyone’s using MVC 3 yet so it is great to have all things working in MVC 2 too but for the future readiness of the book it would’ve been just on spot.

Grz, Kris.
