I was just working on my new macBook pro reading my blog news when I stumbled upon this news: [Popfly beta by Somasegar](/images/popfly-beta.aspx). I had the Silverlight plugin already installed on my Windows Vista/IE7 but wanted to try it out on Mac OSX too. I tested with both Safari and Firefox and both worked very smoothly. Nice to see that Microsoft also provides their plugins for other OS.

Talking about Silverlight, did you know that on October 31st my friend [Gill Cleeren](/images/www.snowball.be) will be presenting the next [MSDN evening about Silverlight](/images/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032355667&Culture=en-US)? If you didn't register yet you'd better hurry. I already played with some of the quickstarts but hope to start developing with Silverlight soon.

Also I obtained a copy of [NDepend](/images/www.ndepend.com). I haven't played with it but after my next deadline, coming wednesday, I'm planning to let it loose on the code we produced during our last SCRUM iteration.

Grz, Kris.
