Recently I was in a discussion about (Azure) DevOps, bugs and their severity. Besides being an interesting discussion we came up with the following list:  

| Level | Name | Example | When to take action |
|---|------------|-|-|
| 4 | Extinction | Your company's going bankrupt soon, Tsjernobyl meltdown | Take action immediately and make it your highest priority, let all your people work on it |
| 3 | Pain       | The bug is so severe that people can't get work done and the company's losing money due to this | Put an emergency team on it and get things solved as the highest priority |
| 2 | Blocking   | There's a bug in the software without a workaround and it's hindering people to get their work done on that part | Locate the bug and if possible/needed make a fix release in a fast cycle |
| 1 | Discomfort | There's some kind of bug in the software but there's a workaround so people can still work | Log it as a bug and try to ship it in a next release |
