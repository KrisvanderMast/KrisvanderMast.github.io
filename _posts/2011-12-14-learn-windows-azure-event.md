The last months were pretty quiet around [ScottGu](/images/ "Scott Guthrie") but yesterday evening, for us Belgian people, there was a [great and lengthy streamed event](/images/learn "Windows Azure Learn") about [Windows Azure](/images/ "Windows Azure"). As I’m the competence center leader of the Azure Cloud Computing team at [Ordina Belgium](/images/www.ordina.be "Ordina") I took the opportunity to gather up with colleagues, ordered pizza and made a great evening.

I’m glad to see this kind of events happening. They provide excellent coverage about the topic, starting out in a way that newcomers can follow with ease but also introducing the latest and greatest tooling and progress the Windows Azure platform has made during the last months. There’s also a ton of great news on the fronts of having people with skills other than [.NET](/images/ ".NET on Windows Azure Developer Center") being served as well. [Node.js](/images/ "Node.js on Windows Azure Developer Center"), [Java](/images/ "Java on Windows Azure Developer Center"), [PHP](/images/ "PHP on Windows Azure Developer Center") and [other technologies](/images/ "Windows Azure Developer Center with examples for C++ and Python") get attention. That’s just awesome!

The [Windowsazure.com website](/images/ "Windows Azure website") also got a major update with that nice looking Metro style sauce over it.

In the past people sometimes feared testing the cloud for budget reasons. Even a colleague of mine once had to find out the hard way that when you shut down an instance but keep the deployment you also keep on getting charged. Microsoft now releases a new way to [explore Azure for 3 months](/images/ "Try Windows Azure") but with a [spending limit](/images/spending-limits "Windows Azure free 3 month trial with spending limits explained"). According to me that promises a safer way to spend researching Azure.

Grz, Kris.
