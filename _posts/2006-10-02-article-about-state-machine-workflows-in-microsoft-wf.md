Just saw on the Belgian MSDN site that Kurt Claeys, a member of [VISUG](/images/ "VISUG") like me, wrote an article about [State machine workflows in Windows Workflow Foundation](/images/wf.mspx "State machine workflows in Windows Workflow Foundation"). Last week we both attended the [.NET 3.0 Framework Development event](/images/NETFramework30DevelopmentMSDNEvent.aspx).

Nice to see that he describes the state machine side of WF. Ingo Rammer did a great explanation about creating workflows on the event but didn't show state machines during his speech.

Grz, Kris.
