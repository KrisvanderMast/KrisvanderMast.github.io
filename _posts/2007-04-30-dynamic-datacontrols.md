If you're an ASP.NET developer like me you're going to love this one: Dynamic Datacontrols.

[Take a look at the video and be amazed](/images/default.aspx?tabid=62). I can't help to think that it resembles BLINQ a lot although still quite different because that was generated by a tool. This time it depends on the name of the folder and page that you give so that the dynamic controls are able to put together whole pages by themselves. I can't really explain it as well as I would love to but just check out the video. It's cool.

Grz, Kris.
