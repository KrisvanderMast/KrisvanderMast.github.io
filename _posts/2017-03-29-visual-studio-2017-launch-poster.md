A couple of weeks Visual Studio 2017 was released to the public. If you want to see the announcements and keynotes be sure to navigate to [https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Visual-Studio/Visual-Studio-2017-Launch/100](/images/100 "https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Visual-Studio/Visual-Studio-2017-Launch/100").

Something I found pretty cool was that this time there was also a free poster which you can [download here](/images/$VisualStudio2017_ProductLaunchPoster.pdf "Visual Studio 2017 Launch Poster") which provides you with an overview of all the new stuff they put in in VS and the languages. Nicely done.

There’s also a bunch of small intro and overview videos of the new features: [https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Visual-Studio/Visual-Studio-2017-Launch](/images/Visual-Studio-2017-Launch "https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Visual-Studio/Visual-Studio-2017-Launch").

Be sure to also check out the newest sample application provided by Microsoft: [BikeSharing360](/images/Exploring-our-newest-sample-app-BikeSharing360 "BikeSharing360"). You can find the code on github:
