Last Monday I went to see the Microsoft Dublin datacenter together with the the [azug posse](/images/www.azug.be "azug") and the two winners of our Windows Azure Saturday. We all signed an NDA so we’re not allowed to talk of what we saw but I can tell you this: if you have the chance someday to visit it yourself and you’re interested in technical stuff, simply go. It’s cool to see and you get a good guidance by a Microsoft representative who’s knowledgeable and friendly. Besides that, it’s in Dublin and they have some very nice restaurants over there.

A picture that I took from <http://www.globalfoundationservices.com/> which was publicly available and shows the datacenter entrance:

The day before we landed in Dublin and one of the gang already knew a great steak restaurant so we enjoyed a great evening among friends.
