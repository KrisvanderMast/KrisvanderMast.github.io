8 years ago I started to program in .NET professionally. Also on that day I started out as a newcomer on the [ASP.NET forums](/images/forums.asp.net). During those years I was first moderated like all newcomers, then unmoderated and after a couple of years I was suddenly asked to become a moderator myself. I’m still doing that because I believe the community invested in me when I was in need of help and now I’m trying to invest my free time myself back into that same community. I hope to be able to keep up the good work there for years to come.
