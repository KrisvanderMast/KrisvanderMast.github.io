Soon, actually June 1st Virtual Machines will go GA on Microsoft’s Windows Azure platform. With that the exact prices are finally known. You can take a look at <http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/overview/> for all technology in the Azure stack. [For VM’s specifically these are the prices known as of now](/images/ "Windows Azure Virtual Machines").

| Compute Instance Name | Virtual Cores | RAM | Price Per Hour (/images/GA Price Starting Jun 1st) | Price Per Hour (/images/Promotional Price Until May 31st) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Extra Small (/images/A0) | Shared | 768 MB | $0.02 (/images/month) | $0.0133 (/images/month) |
| Small (/images/A1) | 1 | 1.75 GB | $0.09 (/images/month) | $0.08 (/images/month) |
| Medium (/images/A2) | 2 | 3.5 GB | $0.18 (/images/month) | $0.16 (/images/month) |
| Large (/images/A3) | 4 | 7 GB | $0.36 (/images/month) | $0.32 (/images/month) |
| Extra Large (/images/A4) | 8 | 14 GB | $0.72 (/images/month) | $0.64 (/images/month) |

And for the more power intensive material:

| COMPUTE INSTANCE NAME | VIRTUAL CORES | RAM | PRICE PER HOUR |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A6 | 4 | 28 GB | $1.02 (/images/month) |
| A7 | 8 | 56 GB | $2.04 (/images/month) |

It’s great to see this entire platform evolve so fast.

Grz, Kris.
