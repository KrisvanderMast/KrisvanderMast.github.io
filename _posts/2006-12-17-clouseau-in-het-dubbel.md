Yesterday evening I attended with several of my friends the concert of [Clouseau](/images/www.clouseau.be), a famous [Flemish](/images/Flemish) band. The concert itself was great with a terrific atmosphere in the Antwerp Sportspalace. After that we went further celebrating the 30th anniversary of one of the gang. I was the designated [Bob](/images/index.asp) of the evening, driving everyone home safely. Luckely I don't need alcohol to enjoy a good time so I didn't mind.

Grz, Kris.
