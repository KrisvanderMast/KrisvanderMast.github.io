While I was reading through all the subscribed blog feeds that I keep track of (/images/indeed too much to read, too little time available) I found out that Charles provides a link to a chapter about 3D in XAML that didn't make it in the final book. You can download it here as a word document: [Chapter 32. Entering the Third Dimension](/images/Chapter32.doc).

Grz, Kris.
