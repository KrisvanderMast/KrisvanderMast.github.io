Sometimes you just stumble upon something new that looks interesting. After a short vacation, too short, I was surfing the web, following twitter, … and ended up at a new page at MSDN: [scriptjunkie{} Serious web development](/images/default(en-us).aspx "scriptjunkie").

It’s a new place for people working with HTML, CSS and Script. I like it that Microsoft shows the love for these 3 quite essential parts of technology as most people became so dependent on them during the last years. In addition to that, after a reorganization on the ASP.NET forums there’s one dedicated to these 3 too: [HTML, CSS and JavaScript](/images/130.aspx "ASP.NET forum: HTML, CSS and JavaScript").

Grz, Kris.
