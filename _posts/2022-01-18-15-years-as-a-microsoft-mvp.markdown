I got my blue ring which marks 15 years of being a [Microsoft MVP][1]. I'm quite proud of that particular achievement to be honest. I started out as an ASP.NET MVP, which was later remapped to Development MVP once all different development style MVP's were put together (like VB.NET, C++, ...). In 2016 I became an Azure MVP which I've been up until this very moment for my contributions in the Azure space via [azug][2] and organizing [CloudBrew][3] and speaking at conferences among others.

15 years... and hopefully many more to come while serving the community, helping others while learning and teaching at the same time myself.
