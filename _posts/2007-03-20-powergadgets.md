A couple of weeks ago I was looking at creating Windows Vista Sidebar Gadgets based upon the tutorial at [MIX university](/images/StudyAtTheUniversity.aspx). If you're interested in that and Powershell you might be interested in [Powergadgets](/images/ "Powergadgets") as well. I just found out about the site but hope to find some free time to explore the goods.

Grz, Kris.
