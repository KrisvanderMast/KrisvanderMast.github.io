Wow, I can’t believe how fast the days went after getting from Brussels to Seattle and now being back again. This year it was again a warm welcome by Microsoft’s employees, interesting keynotes and new stuff to see for what’ll be brought to the big audience in the future. I’ve seen some interesting things, some very interesting things and some very very interesting things during the last couple of days. However due to my NDA disclosure I’m not allowed to talk about it all so you’ll just have to stay put and see what cool stuff’s coming out. It’s going to be interesting for sure.

What can I talk about? Well, I met quite some familiar faces again from people all over the globe whom I unfortunately mostly only see at the MVP summit. Besides that I also got to know a bunch of new people from both Microsoft and other MVPs/ASP Insiders. Had a lot of great conversations and could finally meet the people of whom I only knew the email address so far. It’s been great knowing you all guys and girls!

Another big fun event was that we went to the Seattle Mariners. And…. I got a picture of me with their mascot, the moose:

Grz, Kris.
