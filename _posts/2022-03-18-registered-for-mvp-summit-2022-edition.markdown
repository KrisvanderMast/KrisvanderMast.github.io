That time of year again... the MVP summit. Due to Covid-19 unfortunately again virtual but still great to look forward to. Seeing new technology being presented by the teams that actually make the goods, to give feedback, to _hang out_ with buddies from all over the world.

Before Covid-19 it was always great to really hang out with the people. Going from room to room to follow an interesting lecture. What I miss most though is hanging out in the hallways, talking directly to people from all over the globe, sharing ideas/insights, having a beer in the evening or going to a restaurant for a great steak. Hopefully for a next in person edition.

To all my fellow MVP's: see you soon.
