In Belgium you can never be sure of the weather. It might be great, it might be too hot, it might be too rainy, … You get the picture. Most of the time you simply sit with your beloved laptop surfing on the internet reading news, playing games or learning something new. Learn something new? Cool but where you might ask yourself. Well, Microsoft has released several lessons for the people who want to keep up to date. 
There are 3 available options depending on the time you want to spend: half an hour, a half day or a full day (/images/I recommend that when it’s another drash national).

Make your language choice and enjoy the ride. At the moment there’s information about **Visual Studio 2010** and **Silverlight 4**. In August there will be 2 other tracks as well: **Windows Phone** and **Windows Azure**.

Grz, Kris.
