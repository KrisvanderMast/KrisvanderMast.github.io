Yesterday I attended a workshop about WPF, WCF & WF given at [Ordina](/images/www.ordina.be). One of the presenters used a little tool that I saw Ingo Rammer use also a couple of months ago. The tool itself's called [ZoomIt](/images/ZoomIt.mspx "ZoomIt") and is able to zoom in during a presentation and also provides a pen to draw on the screen while viewing.

It's free and if you're into presenting you can definitely use such a handy tool.

Grz, Kris.
