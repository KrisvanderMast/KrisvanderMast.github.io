Just noticed this article: [Belt-Tightening In Corporate IT Spending Will be Good For Web
2.0](/images/ "Permanent Link to Belt-Tightening In Corporate IT Spending Will be Good For Web 2.0"). With all those heavy loaded words of recession, rising prices, energy costs, ... it's nice to see something positive for a change. 
 
Grz, Kris.
