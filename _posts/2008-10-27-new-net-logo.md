At the PDC a new logo for .NET was introduced:

[![netlogo](/images/netlogo_thumb.png "netlogo")](/images/netlogo_2.png)

It looks like a helix shape to me and that reminds me of that other helix shape: **[DNA](/images/Dna)**. When one says DNA, and who has been around for a while, probably immediately thinks about Microsoft **[DNA](/images/Windows_DNA)**, **Windows Distributed interNet Applications Architecture**.

Actually the helix is also flipped over an angle of 90° and that reminds me of another story: **[Flipping the funnel](/images/flipping_the_fu.html)**. It’s an eBook by Seth Godin. During my college years I liked my course of marketing a lot. Actually when I remember reading this particular book and how the new logo looks… well it kind of mixed you know. The DNA helixes also got flipped like the funnel into a megaphone. It reflects it perfectly as Microsoft tends to spread .NET where it can: on the server, on the desktop, in the browser, …

Grz, Kris.
