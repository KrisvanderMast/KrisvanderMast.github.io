*Join the conversation and explore how you can create next-generation Web
experiences. Now, for the first time in Belgium, the MIX essentials conference
brings you the latest information from the global MIX'08 conference held in Las
Vegas in early March. With Keynote presentations from [Steve Ballmer](/images/speakers.html#steveballmer), and other
international speakers, unveiling the latest Web-oriented solutions from
Microsoft.*
