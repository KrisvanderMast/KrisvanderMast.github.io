### Windows Azure Service Bus

[Windows Azure Service Bus, WASB](/images/ "Windows Azure Service Bus"), has been around for quite a while already but I just noticed that it appeared now as well in the [Preview portal](/images/ "Windows Azure Preview portal") which is cool. It shows off the continued investment by the Microsoft teams to port all of the goodness that Windows Azure provides to the renewed portal instead of keeping it in the old Silverlight based one. I sure do hope soon all, and of course new, features are all ported over and we can make use of the new portal entirely without having to switch back and forth each time.

### Admins and co-admins

Also new in the portal is the fact that one can now create new co-admins for a subscription. That means less round trips to the old portal as well!

### Import a saved database from BLOB storage

A new addition is the ability to import a saved database from BLOB storage.
