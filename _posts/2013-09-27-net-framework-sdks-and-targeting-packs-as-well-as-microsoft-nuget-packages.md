Did you ever get lost in the myriad of SDKs and Microsoft Nuget packages? If you did then let me tell you a secret: you’re not alone. Luckily Microsoft listens very carefully to feedback from their users and community and has put a couple of pages together with some handy overviews:

* [.NET Framework SDKs and Targeting Packs for Visual Studio 2012](/images/hh487283 ".NET Framework SDKs and Targeting Packs for Visual Studio 2012")
* [Microsoft .NET Framework NuGet Packages](/images/nugetpackages.aspx "Microsoft .NET Framework NuGet Packages")

Grz, Kris.
