While looking through some documentation about Microsoft Azure App Insights I noticed a typo in the documentation. In the past that would mean trying to get into contact with the author by email, convincing her/him to update the article, ... Nowadays Microsoft provides an easy link to update the content via Github and markdown and that's what I did. Once you updated the documentation and are satisfied with it you can make a **pull request** so that the owner of the original repro can either accept it or deny it. Mine got accepted pretty quickly and is already online. It's great to see this kind of potential involvement by the community from Microsoft. So..., what are you waiting for? Go check out the documentation and improve it where possible.

The pull request that got accepted itself is: <https://github.com/Azure/azure-content/pull/3463#event-295012378>

The documentation that got updated: <http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-insights-javascript/>

Grz, Kris.
