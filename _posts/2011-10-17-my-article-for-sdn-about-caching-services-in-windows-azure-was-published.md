Last summer I was asked if I could write an article for SDN, a Dutch organization for IT enthusiasts. First time that I wrote for the magazine they offer but I was very pleased with the interaction between myself and the editor.

The article itself is an introduction about the new AppFabric Caching services on Windows Azure.
