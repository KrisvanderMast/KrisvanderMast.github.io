What can you do to compete with something that’s already established for years like Adobe Flash? Deliver something decent yourself but most importantly have content for it. Good content that can interest people. Microsoft created during the past years some great technology that can compete with Flash: Silverlight. Used during the last Olympics gave it already a great boost but that was last year. Continuous delivering good content is important to reach new people. Here comes marketing into play. Well it seems there’s some good content for Silverlight and Deepzoom:

* [World telescope](/images/Home.aspx). A great way to discover the universe around us.
* [Playboy cover to cover](/images/playboy.covertocover.com). Apparently the old numbers are scanned in and viewable. Guess a lot of people will have a lot of reading to do. From what I heard there are some pretty good articles in it.

Grz, Kris.
