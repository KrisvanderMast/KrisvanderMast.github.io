Great news for the ASP.NET MVC fans. After a release of MVC 1 earlier this year today the first preview of version 2 has been [placed on the download servers](/images/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=d34f9eaa-fcbe-4e20-b2fd-a9a03de7d6dd#tm "ASP.NET MVC 2 Preview 1").

Here are the announcements of [Scott Guthrie](/images/asp-net-mvc-v2-preview-1-released.aspx "ASP.NET MVC V2 Preview 1 Released") and [Phil Haack](/images/asp.net-mvc-released.aspx "ASP.NET MVC 2 Preview 1 Released").

Grz, Kris.
