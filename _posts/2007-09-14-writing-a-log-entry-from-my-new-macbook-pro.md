Yes, you're reading correctly, I've bought a brand new macBook pro today. It's quite a new experience for me as I grew up with MS-DOS and Windows. But so far, I like it. I'll probably dual boot it with Windows Vista but I'm also interested in learning Mac OS X. Something I already found out is that it's a very silent notebook and that it doesn't warm up that much like my Dell Latitude D505 does. On the other hand it's still strange to only have 1 mouse button available and so far I haven't found the "End" key to jump to the last place on a line while typing. 
 
In case you're wondering, it's the 15.4" edition, 2,4GHz edition. Up until now, I like what I see. 1 thing I like in particular is the background light on the keyboard. 
 
Grz, Kris.
