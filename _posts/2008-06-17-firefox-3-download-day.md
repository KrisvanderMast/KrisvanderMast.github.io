I just tried to download Firefox 3 from their official site. However that seems to be down. Luckily one of my US buddies, Kevin Jones, knew another site where you can download the goods: <http://mozilla.isohunt.com/firefox/releases/3.0/win32/>. 
 
I hope this also counts for the download marathon. 
 
Grz, Kris.
