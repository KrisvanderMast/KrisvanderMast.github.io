Recently I was at a user group meeting about [Xamarin](/images/www.xamarin.com "Xamarin"). During the session several Macbooks were used. One of presenters wanted to zoom in on something on screen just like he would on Windows with the built in tooling. Turned out to be nobody in the room actually knew how to do it. To add a little disclaimer: we were all heavily Microsoft .NET users who usually spend 90% of their day in Visual Studio, on Windows.

As I didn’t know the answer either, but since a couple of months also use a Macbook pro at work as my main working machine I wanted to know as it’s a neat little feature while doing presentations. Just to step aside: why a Macbook pro when you’re doing .NET development? Well, turns out to be more and more developers are doing so as I noticed at work and not only there. The hardware is very nice and you can run Windows virtually pretty easily on it. I use [Parallels](/images/ "Parallels") myself at the moment but noticed others are making use of alternatives as well.

So how to do it?

### 1. Open System Preferences

And click the Accessibility icon.

Proceed to step 2.

### 2. Zoom settings

Click on the Zoom item in the listbox and there you’ll notice different ways of turning on or off for easy zooming. You can either make use of scrolling (/images/with 2 fingers on the trackpad while holding a key) or making use of a keyboard shortcut combination

Neat!

Grz, Kris.
