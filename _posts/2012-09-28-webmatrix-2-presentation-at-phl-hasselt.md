Yesterday evening I gave a presentation at [Microsoft WebCafe in front of around 120 attendees](/images/9_webcafe-phl). The topic I had was WebMatrix 2. Microsoft WebCafe meetings are of a different concept than traditional presentations. It’s fast paced, 10 minutes time boxed sessions with which they try to get the attention of a group of people which usually don’t come to regular sessions or Tech Days.

The stuff I showed during that very limited amount of time was:

* WebMatrix 2 – the tool (/images/database tooling, reports, requests)
* Bakery based website (/images/ASP.NET web pages)
* Plugins (/images/iPhone + iPad)
* Node.js and debugging capabilities
* publishing to WAWS + updating of only those changed pages via Web Deploy
* Less + plugin from orangebits to transform it to css

If you would like to see more about WebMatrix 2 and what it can mean for you be sure to check out the videos about it on [WebCamps TV](/images/ "WebCamps TV").

If you’re interested in the slide deck I used during my presentation be sure to check out the [Downloads page](/images/downloads.html "Downloads page").

Grz, Kris.
