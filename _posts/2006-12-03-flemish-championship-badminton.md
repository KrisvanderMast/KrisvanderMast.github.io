Today I went to see the A & B ranked badminton competitors in the Flemish Badminton Championship with my badminton partner Guy, who's also a friend of mine for more than 26 years now. Since I play the sport myself it was nice to see the people who are far better than me at work. I just like to play it recreational, although we also go for the win of course :-). Nothing as good as playing a couple of sets against equals after a day of sitting in front of a computer screen.

If you don't know the sport or haven't tried it yet I can really recommend it. It requires technique, you use practically every musscle in your body and it helps you to focus better.

You can learn more about it on [wikipedia](/images/Badminton).

Grz, Kris.
