Either you’re melting away like an ice cream put in the oven or you’re being washed away by rains but there’s one certainty [since last summer](/images/MicrosoftsMSDNSummerCourses.aspx "Microsoft MSDN Summer Courses"): There are several dive in courses from Microsoft to keep you nice and comfortable in front of your pc trying out new stuff and enjoying updates on technologies.

This year Microsoft Belgium has foreseen 2 courses for us:

* [Windows Phone 7 ‘Mango’ update](/images/ff872142 "Windows Phone 7 ‘Mango’ update")
* [Visual Studio 2010 ALM](/images/ff718229 "Visual Studio 2010 ALM")

Take a dive like this person already did:

Grz, Kris.
