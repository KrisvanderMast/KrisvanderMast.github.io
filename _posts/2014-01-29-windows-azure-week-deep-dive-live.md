Or for short [WAWDDL](/images/windows-azure-deep-dive#?fbid=e1P1OkGR15W) ![Smile](/images/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png).

This week you can join up for a week of Windows Azure fun with a bunch of speakers every day that come and deliver interesting screen casts. People like Scott Guthrie, Scott Hanselman, Scott Hunter, … will provide you with insight and knowledge about this still emerging and great technology stack. Don’t miss out!
