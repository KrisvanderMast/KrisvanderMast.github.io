When I arrived early this morning there were cookies made by Subway. For my non Belgian friends: Subway only started in Belgium last year. The sessions [I intended to follow](/images/ImGoingToCommunityDay2010.aspx) were mostly good to great. The catering were special delivered sandwiches from Subway again. I got to know several new people, even got in face to face contact with someone I knew from the [ASP.NET forums](/images/forums.asp.net) but never met in real life before. During the sessions one of the sponsors gave away coupons for books during a per session prize draw (/images/mostly with some quiz from by the presenter). And at the end of the day I won a Bongo bon for a one night stay with breakfast for 2 in one of the 40 hotels you can choose from. Cool! I’m looking forward on going again next year and hopefully be on the speakersboard too.

Grz, Kris.
