Taken from the download site:

*The Windows Server 2008 Developer Training Kit includes a set of hands-on-labs and presentations for technologies such as IIS7, Management, WCF, WF, Windows CardSpace, Windows PowerShell, Virtualization and the Transactional File System (/images/TxF). The content was originally created by Microsoft's Developer & Platform Evangelism group as part of the Windows Server 2008 Touchdown training activities. 
The seven hands-on labs included in this kit are based on the DinnerNow sample application.*
