For some projects I like to start with a blank solution and add several projects to it like a class library, web project, ... Since I installed Visual Studio 2005 Team System for Developers a while ago I wanted to go for this approach for a test project. Unfortunately the solution itself dissapeared after adding the first project.

It turned out to be a setting under Tools | Options, Projects and Solutions where you can check the checkbox **Always show solution**.
