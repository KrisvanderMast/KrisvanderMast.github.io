Hi,

most ASP.NET developers probably already know that there's a wealth of information to be found under the [Learn tab](/images/default.aspx?tabid=63 "Learn ASP.NET") of the [ASP.NET website](/images/ "ASP.NET"). There's video material covering these subjects:

[“How Do I?” with ASP.NET AJAX](/images/#ajax) 
[“How Do I?” with ASP.NET](/images/#howdoi) 
[SQL Server 2005 Express for Beginners](/images/#sql) 
[Videos for ASP.NET 2.0 Beginners](/images/#beginners) 
[“First Look” Videos](/images/#firstlook) 
[Videos on Visual Studio 2005 Add-ins](/images/#vsaddins) 
[Videos on Migrating to ASP.NET](/images/#migrating)

Also I found out that there's also some other interesting video material out there: [http://blogs.interfacett.com/dan-wahlins-blog/](/images/ "http://blogs.interfacett.com/dan-wahlins-blog/"). It has several nice videos on creating and calling web services, C# delegates & events, creating a webservice with WCF, ... Be sure to check it out.

Grz, Kris.
