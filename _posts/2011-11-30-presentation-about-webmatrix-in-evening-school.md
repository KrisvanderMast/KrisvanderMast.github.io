Yesterday evening I gave my first presentation in evening school for adults. The topic of the session was an introduction to [WebMatrix](/images/ "WebMatrix"). The reactions were great and it turned out to be that their regular teacher himself was a big fan of it for creating PHP based websites. It was the first encounter for the students with this technology stack but it clearly appealed to them.

For the second part of the evening, ranging from 7 till 10, I had foreseen a talk about Orchard CMS. A recap of [my live meeting talk](/images/MyFirstLiveMeetingIsOnline.aspx) for Microsoft. Though that would’ve been interesting for them as well I found out during the break that there was also a big interest for an open discussion about career. I’m a master in Electronics (/images/Industrieel ingenieur) but decided after getting my degree that I wanted to make web from hobby into real life work. The students that evening liked my talk how my career went as it could give them insight in a more traditional path with quite some ups and a couple of downs and what it could compare to their career path.

It was a great opportunity for me to talk about tools I came to like a lot and also to present for an audience I normally don’t get in front of me. Their regular teacher gave me as feedback that I did very well and hopes to see me again standing in front of his class. A great comment indeed.

Grz, Kris.
