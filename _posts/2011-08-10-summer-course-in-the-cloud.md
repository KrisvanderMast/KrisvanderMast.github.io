When I look outside I see quite some clouds passing by. Not what you want during summer, especially when rain starts. However there are also fun clouds. They are colored in Azure. Microsoft Belgium provides a new summer course for us: [Dive into the Windows Azure platform this summer](/images/ff872149 "Dive into the Windows Azure platform this summer").

I also blogged about other courses you could take a look at:

* [HTML 5](/images/AnotherMSDNSummerCourse.aspx "Another MSDN summer course")
* [Windows phone 7 Mango update and Visual Studio 2010 ALM](/images/NewSummerNewMSDNSummerCourses.aspx "New summer, new MSDN courses")

Have fun diving into the cool stuff!

Grz, Kris.
