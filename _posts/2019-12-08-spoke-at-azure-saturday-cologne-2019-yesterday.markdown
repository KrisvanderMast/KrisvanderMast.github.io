Yesterday I had the pleasure to speak at [Azure Saturday Cologne, Germany][1] about [Visual Studio Code][2]. The room was filled with interested people and I went off script on quite the occasion as I got a great interaction with the attendees in the room. Showing things they asked for on the spot was a great way to show the usage of extensions and giving value for the attendees time.  

I got some great personal remarks from the attendees themselves and today I got the NSP score from the organization as well:

As the organization put it:

> Awesome Session result! 3rd best session of the entire day.
