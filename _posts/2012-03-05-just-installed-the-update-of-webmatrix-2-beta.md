Just as of today there’s a new update of [WebMatrix 2 Beta for download](/images/betafeatures.aspx "WebMatrix 2 Beta for download"). One of the direct changes that one can see is that WebPages 2 coolness dripped into it too.

For example, in the past one had to write:

```
Order Now
```

And now that has become:

```
Order Now
```

Notice the difference? Cool huh? And WebPages 2 holds more nifty cool features that will help out web developers all around the globe.

I’m looking forward to see this small yet powerful tool come to a final release. Hopefully soon.

Grz, Kris.
