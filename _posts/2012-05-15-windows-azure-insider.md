Today I got the news that I became a Windows Azure Insider. For me that was great news as now I can collaborate with [Microsoft](/images/ "Microsoft") and other Insiders about my findings when experimenting and working with the [Windows Azure platform](/images/ "Windows Azure"). As I’m now, besides being an ASP.NET MVP / ASP Insider, also close to the Windows Azure teams at Microsoft I’m able to get more information/feedback up close and personal. I’m convinced this will help me to help out the community and clients I work for.

Grz, Kris.
