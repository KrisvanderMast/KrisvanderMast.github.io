VISUG offers a presentation, given by my buddy Gill Cleeren, on Silverlight. I'll be attending it and I hope to see several of my other friends there as well. If you're in the neighbourhood and have interest in this new technology be sure to be there. You can still register but hurry up as places are being filled up rapidly.

The place to be is at Ordina in Schelle. To see who already registered take a look at the [VISUG site](/images/www.visug.be).

This is what'll be covered:

* Introduction to XAML* Silverlight 1.0 with Javascript* Silverlight 1.1 with .net* Blend 2 and Silverlight* Features of the final platform to come

Grz, Kris.
