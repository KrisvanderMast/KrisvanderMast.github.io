Tomorrow I'm heading for Seattle for the annual MVP summit. [I just got renewed](/images/IGotMyMVPRenewalFor2008.aspx) so I'm quite happy to be there as a full blown MVP. This is also the first time that I'll be visiting the US. I'm very excited about the whole thing because it means also for me the chance of going to Redmond itself, the "Mekka" for people that are into Microsoft technology.

We'll be arriving on Sunday after a flight of about 10 hours and on Monday stay in Seattle itself. Tuesday and Wednesday all sessions will be at Microsoft campus and Thursday again will be in Seattle. A lot of it will be under NDA but I hope to be able to blog about my adventure while I'm there.

If you're also going: I'm staying in the Sheraton hotel. I'm a very social person that likes to meet new people so don't be shy to come to me and say hi.

Grz, Kris.
