I just noticed that the Developer Tools blog got an update and now try to get things more closely together [from one starting screen on](/images/ "Microsoft Developer Tools blog"). If you want to read more about it all I suggest you [take a look at the announcement made by Lisa Feigenbaum](/images/welcome-to-the-developer-tools-blog-network.aspx "Microsoft updated Developer Tools Blog").

Another cool news is that the **[Dark Theme for the upcoming Visual Studio 11](/images/visual-studio-dark-theme.aspx "Microsoft Visual Studio 11 Dark Theme")** will look like the following when it’s going to be released:

And

I think that’s awesome. Now the next thing on my wish list is that Microsoft Research Labs finally starts making those red lightsabers ![Smile](/images/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png).

And while we wait for all the great stuff coming we can still listen to some nice music:

Grz, Kris.
