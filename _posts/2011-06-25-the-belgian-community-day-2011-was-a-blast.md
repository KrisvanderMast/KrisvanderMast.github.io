Well organized and in a great location last Thursday the fifth edition of Community day was held. I gave a presentation myself about giving applications a second life in the cloud. It was a lot of fun to do so and I already got some great feedback from people in the audience. For the people who couldn’t make it, here are my slides:

**[A second life in the cloud for existing applications](/images/a-second-life-in-the-cloud-for-existing-applications "A second life in the cloud for existing applications")**

View more [presentations](/images/www.slideshare.net) from [Kris van der Mast](/images/KrisvdM).

If you’re interested in getting me over for your community to talk about ASP.NET (/images/MVC), Razor, WebMatrix, jQuery, Azure, … just drop me a note or follow me on twitter: [@KvdM](/images/kvdm "Kris van der Mast on Twitter").

Grz, Kris.
