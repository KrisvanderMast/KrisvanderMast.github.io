Play in a more beautiful web, explore [Internet explorer 9 Beta](/images/home?os=win7&arch=a&browser=ie). It’s great to see that Microsoft reveals its newest browser to the world.

There’s quite a lot of [new and exciting stuff](/images/whats-new-in-internet-explorer-9) going on in IE9 like:

* Streamlined design
* Pinned sites (/images/Windows 7)
* Download manager
* Enhanced tabs
* A new tab page (/images/with color coding for ease of use)
* You can now search in the address bar
* A new notification bar
* An add-on performance advisor (/images/which add-on makes your browser go slow?)

Grz, Kris.
