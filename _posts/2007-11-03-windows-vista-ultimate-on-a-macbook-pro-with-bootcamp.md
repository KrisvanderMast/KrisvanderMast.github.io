I just installed succesfully Vista Ultimate on my MacBook Pro with the bootcamp utility. Quite easy to setup actually. You just need to keep in handy your Vista install DVD and the Leopard installation DVD for the necessary extra driver installations to get the hardware to work. Aero works like a charm and the speed is also very nice. I still need to figure out where all the keys are located and which works and which doesn't but up untill now it looks promising.

Grz, Kris.
