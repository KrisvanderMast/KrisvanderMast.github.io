Last year it was only a half day but apparently this year it’s going to be a full blown day of content by several of Belgian user groups. Keep June 25th reserved for this day.

Read more about it here as long as the new site’s not up and running: [http://www.communityday.be/CD/](/images/ "http://www.communityday.be/CD/").

Grz, Kris.
