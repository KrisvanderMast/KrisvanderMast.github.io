Today I got to hear that my grandfather passed away. He almost made it to the age of 92, a very respectable age, especially if you know that he still drove with his car up until he became 90. He has always been interested in technology and I really enjoyed our talks during the years I had the pleasure to know him. During the last months of his life my family and myself tried to spend as much time as possible with him, helping him out, trying to cheer him up during tough periods. I’s always painful to have to let go of someone you liked a lot and had a place in your personal education to become a decent person.

Grz, Kris.
