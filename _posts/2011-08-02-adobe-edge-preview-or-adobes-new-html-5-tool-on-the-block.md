Today Adobe released it’s latest tool in preview mode: Edge.

From the [announcing site](/images/ "Adobe Edge"):

> Adobe® Edge is a new web motion and interaction design tool that allows designers to bring animated content to websites, using web standards like HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS3.
>
> Edge will be updated regularly to add new functionality, stay ahead of evolving web standards, and incorporate user feedback to provide the best functionality and experience possible. This is an early look at Edge with more capabilities to come.

For samples take a look here: [http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/edge/resources/](/images/ "Adobe Edge resources and samples").

For a nice video showing off some of the capabilities take a look at [this article and youtube movie](/images/adobe-ditches-flash-for-adobe-edge "Adobe Edge capabilities").

It’s cool to see that there are coming tools on the market from big vendors targeting HTML 5. I hope others do too.

Microsoft's [Expression Web 4 SP1 adds HTML 5 + CSS 3 support](/images/details.aspx?id=1787 "Expression Web 4 SP1") already.
