Actually I wasn't expecting this one for a couple of weeks but I just read on the blog of [Scott Guthrie](/images/scottgu) that they [just released it](/images/details.aspx?FamilyId=25144C27-6514-4AD4-8BCB-E2E051416E03&displaylang=en).

Something else I'm waiting for is Visual Source Safe for Visual Studio 2008 so I can install it locally on my new dev machine. Unfortunately it's been [delayed for a couple of weeks](/images/update-for-visual-sourcesafe-coming.aspx).

Grz, Kris.
