Just noticed via [Twitter](/images/www.twitter.com "Twitter") that there’s a new December 2011 update available: [Visual Studio 2010 and .NET Framework 4 Training Kit December 2011 update](/images/details.aspx?id=23507 "Visual Studio 2010 and .NET Framework 4 Training Kit December 2011 update"). This training kit holds a lot of interesting small videos, demos, code, … oh my.

Today I also found out about a blog post that lists around [30 free books](/images/30-free-programming-ebooks). Books about javascript, Ruby, C#, …

Grz, Kris.
