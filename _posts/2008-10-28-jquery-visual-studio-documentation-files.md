I just noticed that on the site of [jQuery](/images/Downloading_jQuery "jQuery") there’s now also [a download available](/images/jquery-1.2.6-vsdoc.js "jQuery Visual Studio Intellisense") for having a much better intellisense experience. It’s actually a big js file with xml comment that Visual Studio can interpret but it can be used to power up the development experience. Also when you do reference this only do so while developing and don’t put this into production since it’s waaaay bigger than the minified version (/images/or the packed one). So make sure that you set that into production instead.

Update: I just found out about these **[extra handy tips](/images/rich-intellisense-for-jquery.aspx)** for adding the documented jQuery file to your pages.

Grz, Kris.
