Today I'm celebrating my lustrum on the [ASP.NET forums](/images/forums.asp.net). That also means that I started developing with .NET 5 years ago officially. I learned a lot in those 5 years and not only on a technical level. With this post I would also like to thank Patrick Vanoverbeke for picking me out of the crowd to start developing ASP.NET applications back then and giving me the opportunity to grow on a steady pace.

First I was more of a person that asked questions, trying to seek knowledge for problems. After a while I suddenly noticed a certain post, can't remember which one though, that I could provide the answer to. I did and got a friendly reply with a big thank you back. Well that gave a good feeling so I started out giving more and more answers. Somehow I got noticed by the moderation team and when they asked to join them I became a moderator to help even more people out. This year I also became an MVP thanks to my strong participation on the forums.

Grz, Kris.
