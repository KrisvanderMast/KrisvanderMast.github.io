On a regular basis Microsoft brings out cool and easy to follow tutorials. I just noticed that the ones about Entity Framework and ASP.NET MVC got updated.

For Entity Framework the following new things in version 6 are handled:

* Connection resiliency
* Command interception
* Code-based configuration
* Async
* Stored procedures

9 tutorials were refurbished:

* [Creating an Entity Framework data model](/images/creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application)
* [Implementing basic CRUD functionality](/images/implementing-basic-crud-functionality-with-the-entity-framework-in-asp-net-mvc-application)
* [Sorting, filtering, and paging](/images/sorting-filtering-and-paging-with-the-entity-framework-in-an-asp-net-mvc-application)
* [Connection resiliency and command interception](/images/connection-resiliency-and-command-interception-with-the-entity-framework-in-an-asp-net-mvc-application)
* [Code First Migrations and deployment](/images/migrations-and-deployment-with-the-entity-framework-in-an-asp-net-mvc-application)
* [Creating a more complex data model](/images/creating-a-more-complex-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application)
* [Reading related data](/images/reading-related-data-with-the-entity-framework-in-an-asp-net-mvc-application)
* [Updating related data](/images/updating-related-data-with-the-entity-framework-in-an-asp-net-mvc-application)
* [Async and stored procedures](/images/async-and-stored-procedures-with-the-entity-framework-in-an-asp-net-mvc-application)

And 3 new tutorials were created:

* [Handling concurrency](/images/handling-concurrency-with-the-entity-framework-in-an-asp-net-mvc-application)
* [Implementing inheritance](/images/implementing-inheritance-with-the-entity-framework-in-an-asp-net-mvc-application)
* [Advanced scenarios](/images/advanced-entity-framework-scenarios-for-an-mvc-web-application)

For people who’re still on older versions don’t despair, they’re still available under [http://www.asp.net/mvc/tutorials/getting-started-with-ef-5-using-mvc-4](/images/getting-started-with-ef-5-using-mvc-4 "Getting started with Entity Framework 5 and ASP.NET MVC 4")

Grz, Kris.
