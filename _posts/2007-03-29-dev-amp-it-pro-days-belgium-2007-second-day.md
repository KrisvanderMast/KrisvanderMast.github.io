Today I attended the second, actually [third day if you include the pre-conference](/images/DevAmpITProDayPreConferenceWithJeffProsise.aspx), and it was fun to see so many people I haven't seen in a long time.

The sessions I followed:

* C# 3.0: Future directions in language innovation: a nice session on the new and upcoming code constructs in C#. Raj Paj showed the ways Microsoft changed the constructs in order to be able to have LINQ into the next version.
* Real world customization of Windows Workflow Foundation: a session presented by Ingo Rammer. It's already the ...th time that I saw Ingo present and I'm still amazed of the the lightning speed he can type while standing. The presentation was interesting but it was so extremely hot in the room that it became quite difficult to keep up.
* Thinking Powershell: strange enough this session was attended by a lot of developers while it was intended for IT pro's. Some of my collegues found it to not be so interesting but others, myself included, are drawn to [the possibilities it can offer for developers](/images/Powergadgets.aspx).
* Profiling and optimizing .NET applications: again a session by Ingo. And yet again an interesting one. Looking at the ways and tools that are available to developers, ranging from Fiddler, SQL Profiler and .NET profiler.
* Building WCF-based services with WF-enabled WF logic: Presented by Christian Weyer. Also the ...th time I see Christian present. What I got from this presentation, and that was also the thought of my collegues, is that it's still a pain at the moment to integrate both easily. I still plan on taking a look at WF when I have the time though. Especially since I heard that the next version of ASP.NET will also likely have WF integrated.

Grz, Kris.
