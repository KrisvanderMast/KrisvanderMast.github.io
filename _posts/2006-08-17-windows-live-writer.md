Hi,

I'm just testing out [Windows Live Writer](/images/windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com). A completely new tool by Microsoft, still in Beta but it works already great with dasBlog. You can also extend it with extra plugins (/images/1). It still lacks some extra's but I already like the nice integration with dasBlog. Even the Categories are available.

Update: There are already some nice plugins available on [CodePlex](/images/www.codeplex.com): [Window Live Writer Plugins](/images/View.aspx?ProjectName=WLWPlugins), [Flickr4Writer](/images/View.aspx?ProjectName=flickr4writer) and [Tag4Writer](/images/View.aspx?ProjectName=tag4writer). 
Update 2: It seems another [VISUG](/images/www.visug.be) member also has created a plugin for Live Writer: [SyntaxColor4Writer](/images/index.php?title=SyntaxColor4Writer).

Grz, Kris.
