Today I was one of the people that stood on the "Ask the expert" booth at Techdays Belgium 2008. It was the first time I did this and I really enjoyed it. If Microsoft would ask me again I would be happy to help them out again on the next occasion. The fun thing was that I got to know a lot of new people, even at the booth itself. This is something I really enjoy, talk to people, get to know new people, interact and share ideas/views with them on technology.

I also got the chance to help people out with their particular questions just like I would on the [ASP.NET forums](/images/forums.asp.net) but this way it's more direct of course because you're talking to the person right in front of you. I found it a bit strange though that one of the askers was creating ASP.NET applications for quite some time but didn't found out about the [ASP.NET dedicated website](/images/www.asp.net). I showed the wealth of information that can be found over there and he really enjoyed seeing that and immediately wrote down the url. The most asked question however seemed to be this one: "When is the Entity Framework shipping date?". That was also the one we couldn't answer at our booth unfortunately.

Grz, Kris.
