Hi,

I always like to recommend these tutorials to people who are taking their first steps with ASP.NET 2.0. Since I have a couple days off I thought, why not take the lessons myself? The first tutorial shows how to use TableAdapters, which was something I never used before, so it also turned out to be very interesting for me too.

[You can find the data tutorials here](/images/default.aspx?tabid=63 "Data tutorials for ASP.NET 2.0").

The next weekend and weeks I hope to spend some time on ASP.NET AJAX as well.

Grz, Kris.
