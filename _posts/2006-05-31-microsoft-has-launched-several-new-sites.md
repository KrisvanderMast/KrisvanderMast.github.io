Just found out about this one: <http://www.seewindowsvista.com/>. It has some smooth looking videos available organised into 4 categories:

* Connecting with people* Managing the big picture* Turning information into action* Expanding your possibilities

Another site that was release recently is <http://www.iis.net/>, a site totally dedicated to IIS6 and the new [upcoming IIS7](/images/default.aspx?tabid=7). Also be sure to [check out the virtual labs](/images/iisnet).

Some other sites about upcoming technologies that'll ship with Vista, and will also be available for Windows XP with Service Pack 2 and Windows server 2003:

* [WPF](/images/default.aspx) (/images/Windows Presentation Foundation, formerly known as Avalon)* [WCF](/images/Default.aspx?tabindex=0&tabid=1) (/images/Windows Communication Foundation, formerly known as Indigo)* [WF](/images/Default.aspx?tabindex=0&tabid=1) (/images/Windows Workflow Foundation)

Of course, people who know me, know that <http://forums.asp.net/> is still one of my most visited sites. Not only to help out people there but also to still learn from others too.

Grz, Kris.
