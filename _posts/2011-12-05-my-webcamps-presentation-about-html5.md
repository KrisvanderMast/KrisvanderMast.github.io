Today I gave my first [Webcamps](/images/web "Webcamps") session at Microsoft Belgium. The agenda for the day was

*9:00 – 10:30*

***Web Platform Overview and open source Web Apps***

*Get a good overview of the Microsoft Web Platform, free tooling like Visual Studio 2010, Web Developer Express, IIS web server and a peek at what’s coming in Visual Studio 11 and ASP.NET MVC 4.*

*After the general introduction we’ll show you around Orchard CMS, Umbraco and other open source CMS apps using WebMatrix.*

*10:30 – 11:00*

*Coffee Break*

*11:00 – 12:30*

***Practical HTML5***

*This session kicks off with a good overview of the different elements in HTML5 that make up this umbrella term. We’ll go over standards HTML, new CSS3 specs and font usage and web app specs. Most importantly, the session will also address how you can start taking advantage of new features in the specs while still supporting older browsers through the use of polyfills and frameworks like Modernizr.*

*To finish you’ll learn how to make your website shine on the Windows 7 taskbar through site pinning.*

*12:30 – 13:30*

*Lunch*

***Afternoon – Hands-on labs***

*13:30 – 17:00*

***Hands-on labs***

*The afternoon is hands-on, the perfect timing to apply the learning from the morning session.*

*Labs include creating a website using a web app by leveraging, practical HTML5 and CSS3 labs addressing Canvas, WOFF, CSS3 layout features and more.*

*At the end of the session you’ll have a good practical feeling on how to use and customize open source web apps as well as leveraging the best in HTML5 today.*

*17:00 – 17:15*

*Closing, discussion, top recommended resources*

There were 2 hands on labs foreseen. One recycled from Microsoft Webcamps USA about HTML 5 and another one I completely wrote myself about Orchard and on which I got some great feedback from the people who made it during the afternoon.

About 35 people followed the course and I already got quite some questions after the first session was sold out if there were others going to happen. Luckily I can answer that question in a positive way as the following dates are foreseen for a redelivery:

* [Wednesday January 11th 2012](/images/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032498902&Culture=nl-BE)
* [Monday February 6th 2012](/images/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032498903&Culture=nl-BE)
* [Tuesday March 20th 2012](/images/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032498904&Culture=nl-BE)

Even though I got some great feedback in the evaluation round I also want to take the entire feedback with me into my next presentation to perform even better. Hope to see you in 2012!

Grz, Kris.
