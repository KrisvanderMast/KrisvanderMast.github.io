Yesterday I had the pleasure to deliver my first international presentation in Lebanon. The talk was about ASP.NET MVC 2 which got recently released topped with some jQuery. Since I knew that most people didn’t have hands on experience with MVC I made a more entry level presentation, explaining why it was introduced by Microsoft and what it was. Then I used several demos especially crafted to demonstrate some of the handy and powerful additions like data annotations and the interaction with jQuery validation, templated helpers, partial views, using a JsonResult together with jQuery to fill up html elements dynamically, …

For me it was a great experience and I got several felicitations from the spectators. I myself would like to thank [Bilal Haidar](/images/default.aspx "Bilal Haidar") for getting me into contact with the Lebdev user group and [Samer Chidiac](/images/ "Samer Chidiac") from Microsoft Lebanon for organizing this event at [Berytech](/images/ "Berytech Beirut Lebanon").

The slidedeck that I used can already be found on slideshare:
