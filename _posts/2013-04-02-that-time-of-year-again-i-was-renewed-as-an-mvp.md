Yes! I got the email message in my inbox yesterday evening that [I got renewed as an MVP](/images/Kris%20van%20der%20Mast-38656 "Kris van der Mast - MVP"). I’m of course very happy to be renewed for the efforts I made during the past year in the community.

I also got to hear that several of my buddies also got renewed and that Mike Martin got his for the first time. Congratulations to all!

As you can see I had to celebrate this last evening with another MVP: Bilal Haidar who was visiting Belgium.

Grz, Kris.
