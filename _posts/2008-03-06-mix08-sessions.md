You can already **[start downloading the MIX08 sessions](/images/sessions.visitmix.com)**. I just finished watching the keynote and boy am I looking forward to Silverlight 2 final edition. Also the new capabilities of IE8 are looking very promising and I bet every web developer/designer is really looking forward to the support of CSS2.1 in it. Hopefully Microsoft decides to push IE8 to every windows installation as soon as possible after the final release so we can get rid of IE6/7 incompatibilities and CSS hacks just to get it to work.

Grz, Kris.
