Always nice to see a working example when learning something new. I just noticed that the list of starter kits has grown. [Be sure to check them out](/images/starter-kits). It seems that there are already 3 versions of the Club Starter Kit, 1 created by Microsoft people and 2 extended versions by the community. Also take a look at the, just started, [starterkits.org](/images/www.starterkits.org) site.

Grz, Kris.
