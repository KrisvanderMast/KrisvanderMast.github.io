It seems Microsoft recently put up a couple of new sites that might be of interest to you: 
 

* A revamped site dedicated to the [**Expression family**](/images/cc136510%28en-us%29.aspx): There's lot to find already, tutorials, starter kits, forums, ... While the Expression family's mostly targeted towards designers I also used Expression Web in the past and currently am taking my first steps in Blend 2.5 preview to get to know Silverlight 2 a bit better.
* [**TaskMarket**](/images/Home.aspx): a new place for freelancers to find each other for short term assignments.

 
Grz, Kris.
