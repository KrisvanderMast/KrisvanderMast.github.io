In case you're still unaware of it, **[Community day](/images/CD)** is going to be held on June 26th. This is a free day with interesting technical content provided by the combined forces of several **[Belgian user groups](/images/Default.aspx)**. Be sure to check out the **[agenda](/images/Default.aspx)** of what's provided that day.

I'm also going to be there so if you'd like to say, hi just come over and do so.

Grz, Kris.
