Last Tuesday I performed my first live meeting for Microsoft. Topic: [Orchard the new CMS in town](/images/Orchard-Open-Source-CMS-the-new-CMS-in-town "Orchard the new CMS in town").

Check it out at [http://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/adebruyn/Orchard-Open-Source-CMS-the-new-CMS-in-town](/images/Orchard-Open-Source-CMS-the-new-CMS-in-town "http://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/adebruyn/Orchard-Open-Source-CMS-the-new-CMS-in-town") for the video and slides.

Grz, Kris.
