A while ago someone from the testing came asking that a certain feature really didn’t look good in IE6. Since I’m on Vista with IE7 myself and didn’t want to go through the hassle of trying to install IE6 or start working with vpcs I decided to look around for something that could help me out. The tool I ended up with is [IETester](/images/HomePage). It’s handy to use and free so I suggest you give it a try.

Btw, I was able to solve the problem quite quickly since I could now test on my own development machine and see the instant results.

Grz, Kris.
