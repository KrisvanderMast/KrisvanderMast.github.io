Yep, a free eBook to download. I have yet to read it myself but already took a quick glance at it. [You can download it here](/images/details.aspx?familyid=500a33c1-5a68-4fcd-93ef-b27f053539cf&displaylang=en&tm).

Also it's been a while since I blogged or been active on the [ASP.NET forums](/images/forums.asp.net). The main reason for this is that I got another project which requires me to travel about 3.5 hours a day minimum. It's an interesting project that uses SCRUM methodology but this means that there are also very tight deadlines to reckon with (/images/and weekend work) and this weighs on my availability to do some digging and providing valuable content to my blog.

If someone knows a decent tutorial about NHibernate and the Validation Application Block that ships with Enterprise Library please leave a comment.

Grz, Kris.
