Learning new technologies is always some part fun, some excitement but also can cause some frustration when something doesn't work like you would expect it. For the first part there are a huge amount of books available but Microsoft is also being busy creating videos for their ASP.NET technology and since recently also for the upcoming Atlas technology. [You can find the videos here](/images/default.aspx?tabid=63).

Of course, when things get frustrating and need help you can always visit the [ASP.NET forums](/images/forums.asp.net).

Grz, Kris.
