On Monday we already had the pleasure of having Brady over for a nerd dinner in Mechelen and yesterday Brady delivered a great presentation about [Windows Azure Web Sites](/images/ "Windows Azure Web Sites"). The talk was mainly about the architecture behind the screens, deployment and pricing. Brady was warned up front that a Belgian audience is usually very quiet, extremely attentive but lacks interaction. Well, not so at AZUG! We were indeed all very attentive but definitely not quiet and without interaction. Quite some laughs / jokes flew back and forth and both the audience and Brady had a great time during the evening.

We also had a lot of new faces coming to our latest AZUG event and that’s just awesome as that’s why were hosting these sessions for: you, the community. The AZUG crew hopes to see you again soon at one of our next events: <http://www.azug.be/events>.
