Last Saturday was not only beautiful weather in Belgium, actually it was really great weather, but it was also Global Azure Bootcamp. Me and [Tom Kerkhove](https://blog.tomkerkhove.be/) ran the Belgian chapter during the entire day and we collaborated with the great people of [ITnetx](http://itnetx.ch/) to host the event at their venue.  

As for the agenda, we had a good looking one:
