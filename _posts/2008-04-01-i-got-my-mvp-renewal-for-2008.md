I just noticed this message in my inbox:

*Dear Kris Van Der Mast,*

*Congratulations! We are pleased to present you with the 2008 Microsoft® MVP Award! The MVP Award is our way to say thank you for promoting the spirit of community and improving people’s lives and the industry’s success every day. We appreciate your extraordinary efforts in ASP/ASP.NET technical communities during the past year.*

I admit that I'm at least a bit proud of myself. Especially because I was able to help out people that were in need of getting into the right direction. And for the next year? Well I'll try to do my best to keep on helping the community.

Grz, Kris.
