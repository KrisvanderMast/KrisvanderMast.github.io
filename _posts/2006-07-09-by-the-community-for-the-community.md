I found out about this new page on [ASP.NET](/images/www.asp.net), thanks to [PeteL](/images/659382.aspx) and [Brian Goldfarb](/images/659477.aspx): [**By the Community, For the Community**](/images/Default.aspx?tabindex=6&tabid=50).

*The **By The Community, For the Community** samples series will create ASP.NET samples that are in high demand. These samples will not be created by Microsoft but instead by a select group of ASP.NET community member MVPs. You can see their bios below.*

*On a regular basis, starting Friday July 7th, we will publish a list of potential samples and allow the community to vote on which sample they are most interested in seeing developed. After the voting ends, the select MVPs will then create the sample using best practices. The samples will be published and then linked to from this page on* [*www.asp.net*](/images/www.asp.net)*.*

So go out and vote for the stuff that you want these guys to create! Personally I love this idea. There are a lot of smart people out there with an MVP status and they're getting more attention. Just think of the Wrox book MVP hacks for example. The [ASP.NET forums](/images/forums.asp.net) also have a bunch of MVP people hanging around to help out other people.

Grz, Kris.
