April 1st is always an exciting day, did I make it again as an MVP for the annual renewal or not? Well, I’m very happy to announce that I made it again. Due to the changes in the program I’m not an ASP.NET MVP as such anymore. The title has changed to Visual Studio and Development Technologies MVP.

To all other MVP’s who got renewed and to all new ones: congratulations!

Grz, Kris.
