During the last year I’ve seen several really cool looking WPF applications. But actually mostly demo material. Well today I installed **[blu](/images/blu)**. It’s a fancy little tool that connects to your twitter account. You can send direct messages, update your status, tiny url integration. I love it!!

The site of thirteen23 claims that you need Vista or Windows 7 but I just installed on my laptop that still runs Windows XP Pro without a problem.

Here’s a screen shot:

Oh yeah, you can also follow me on twitter of course: [http://twitter.com/KvdM](/images/KvdM "http://twitter.com/KvdM").

Grz, Kris.
