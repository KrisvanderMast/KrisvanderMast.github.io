I just installed Windows Vista Enterprise edition. The graphics card of my laptop only got a score of 1.9 so I'm not into Aero. My hard drive however, a brand new 100 Gb 7200 rpm, got a score of 5.0. And indeed, installing Vista on it was much faster then I could imagine. I also just installed IIS and now will begin with Visual Studio 2005 Team System For Developers and SQL Server 2005 for developers to get as quickly as possible up to speed again.

Grz, Kris.
