Last year I [didn't get renewed as an MVP][1]. I was disappointed but I understood the decision as many lost it that time due to the _culling_ after the Covid-19 era where the year before every MVP didn't loose her/his award and got automatically reawarded.  

Well, this year I got the award back. I'm very happy with it and I'm looking forward to another year of MVP awesomeness. I even got a great looking badge on Credly now.  

In April 2007 I became an MVP for the first time for __ASP.NET__ which was a couple of years later put into a bigger pool of __Developer Technologies__ containing not only .NET but also C++, Python, .... In 2016 I becamen an __Azure MVP__ (actually in 2016 I had both the Developer Technologies and Azure MVP award). And it ended last year in July 2022.

As of now I'm an __MVP Developer Technologies__ again. I'm still going strong organizing [azug meetups][3], [CloudBrew conference][4], [Global AI Belgian chapter][5] and more to come as well as speaking at [conferences and user groups][6].

If you want to celebrate with me you might want to buy me a coffee or a beer.
