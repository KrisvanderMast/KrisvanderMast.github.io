2017 already is going to kick off with presentations. Besides Microsoft Cloud Summit I’m also going to speak at the [Basta! conference in Frankfurt Germany](/images/#day4 "Basta!"). This time about [Visual Studio Code](/images/ "Visual Studio Code"). I hope to see you there. It’s the first time I’ll be speaking in Germany so I’m looking forward to the adventure.

Kris.
