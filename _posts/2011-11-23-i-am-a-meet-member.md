I got informed that I became a MEET member by my Belgian DPE representative at Microsoft. MEET stands for Microsoft Extended Experts Team.

From the official page there’s more information about the program itself:

Do you have a complex problem, but not the knowledge to solve it? Then you can get in contact with the community of Belgian experts. 
All members of MEET are selected for their knowledge and skills in their field. And they are also excellent communicators. All share knowledge through their personal blogs and they are also frequent speakers at Microsoft events or their respective user group. 
MEET gets the explicit support of Microsoft Belgium and Luxembourg.

Of course I’m honored by receiving this award.

Grz, Kris.
