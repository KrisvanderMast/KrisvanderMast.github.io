And another year, a great year, has passed. I’ve been reawarded as MVP, went to the US where I was able to drive around for a week and see the Grand canyon, Monument valley, Bryce canyon, Death valley, Las Vegas. A month later I visited the Middle East (/images/Lebanon) where during my vacation I also [gave a presentation about ASP.NET MVC 2](/images/HadMyFirstForeignSpeakerExperienceInLebanon.aspx). I got to know a lot of new and great people and learnt new things. All in all a great year.

Grz, Kris.
