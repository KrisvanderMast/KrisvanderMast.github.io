Microsoft’s investing in CDN for a lot of their ajax scripts and also jQuery, we already knew that for a while. Now they also added support for SSL so when you use your site with http**s** it shouldn’t give an enduser the warning anymore about mixed content. The very well known “This page contains both secure and nonsecure items” message.

There’s a whole list available out there: [http://www.asp.net/ajaxlibrary/cdn.ashx](/images/cdn.ashx "Microsoft Ajax CDN overview").

At first I didn’t see the dataservice.js scripts anymore, the ones that enable people to use ajax against ADO.NET Data Services, I mean **[WCF Data Services](/images/simplifying-our-n-tier-development-platform-making-3-things-1-thing.aspx "WCF Data Services")** after the product got renamed, but they also got renamed to:

- <http://ajax.microsoft.com/ajax/beta/0911/MicrosoftAjaxAdoNet.debug.js>
- <http://ajax.microsoft.com/ajax/beta/0911/MicrosoftAjaxAdoNet.js>

Besides the new CDN SSL feature there’s also a [new Library available for Microsoft Ajax](/images/ajaxlibrary). Also quite a lot of [new tutorials have been added for the new Ajax library](/images/learn.ashx "Tutorials").

Grz, Kris.
