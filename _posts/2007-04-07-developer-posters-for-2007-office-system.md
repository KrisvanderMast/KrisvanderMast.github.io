Thanks to [Bart Wessel's blog](/images/10977.aspx) I found out about the existence of these posters:

* **Developer Roadmap for the 2007 Microsoft Office System.*** **Microsoft Office InfoPath 2007 Managed Object Model Poster.*** **Developer Map for SharePoint Products and Technologies Poster.**

[You can download them here](/images/details.aspx?familyid=771aeb45-9d27-4d1f-acd1-9b950637d64e&displaylang=en).

Grz, Kris.
