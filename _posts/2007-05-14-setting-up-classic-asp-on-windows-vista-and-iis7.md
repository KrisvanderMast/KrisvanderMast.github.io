Since I'm going to be doing some months of development with classic ASP on my Windows Vista Enterprise machine I had to set it up specifically. So this is not only a post for others but also one for myself in case I have to do it again in the future.

Go to control panel | Programs | Turn Windows featurs on or off | Internet Information Services | World Wide Web Services | Application Development Features | ASP.
