Today I got the message that my MVP got extended for another year. That’s great news and I’ll make sure to keep up the things that are community related during the coming year. A good example of this is that next week during my vacation to Lebanon I’ll be giving a presentation about MVC 2 for Lebdev, a local user group. It’ll be my first foreign talk so I’m looking towards to it with a lot of excitement.

Grz, Kris.
