If you’re a bit like me you like to have a lot of keyboard shortcuts handy while coding in your favorite IDE, Visual Studio. In the past I blogged about cheat sheets for [former versions of Visual Studio](/images/KeyboardShortcutsForVisualStudio2005.aspx "Visual Studio 2005 keyboard shortcuts") but I recently found out about documents for 4 different languages in Visual Studio 2010: C#, F#, VB.NET and C++.

[Take a look here to download these](/images/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=92ced922-d505-457a-8c9c-84036160639f "Visual Studio 2010 keybinding cards").

Grz, Kris.
