No, this isn't some spam about getting your degree from university for $... This blog post is about the [MIX university](/images/ "http://www.visitmix.com/university/") where you can get handson labs about WPF, Virtual Earth, ASP.NET AJAX or Vista Sidebar Gadgets. Check it out: [http://www.visitmix.com/university/](/images/ "http://www.visitmix.com/university/")

Grz, Kris.
