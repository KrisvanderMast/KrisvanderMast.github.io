Hi,

[last saturday I already wrote about the new anti XSS library](/images/AntiCrossSiteScriptingLibrary.aspx "Anti XSS Library") and I just found out there's a dedicated forum for all your question available. Take a look here: [Anti-Cross Site Scripting Library.](/images/ShowForum.aspx)

Grz, Kris.
