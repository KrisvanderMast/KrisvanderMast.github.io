I blogged about the nice feature of Conversation in a former post but I just found out, thanks to Joe Stagner (/images/the guy behind the learning videos at the ASP.NET site), about adding a calendar to your email. Check out this post: [Office 2007 Coolness...Part 1 of at least 10!](/images/office-2007-coolness-part-1-of-at-least-10.aspx "Office 2007 Outlook calendar")

Grz, Kris.
