I just received this email from Microsoft:

*Dear Kris van der Mast,*

*Congratulations! We are pleased to present you with the 2007 Microsoft® MVP Award! 
The Microsoft MVP Award is our way of saying thank you and to honor and support the significant contributions you make to communities worldwide. As a recipient of Microsoft’s Most Valuable Professional award, you join an elite group of technical community leaders from around the world who foster the free and objective exchange of knowledge by actively sharing your real world expertise with users and Microsoft. Microsoft salutes all MVPs for promoting the spirit of community and enhancing people’s lives and the industry’s success everyday. To learn more about the MVP Program, visit:* [*www.microsoft.com/mvp*](/images/mvp)*. 
Your extraordinary efforts in Visual Developer - ASP/ASP.NET technical communities during the past year are greatly appreciated.*

Of course I'm very happy with this recognition and I hope to be able to help out even more people during the next years to come by writing articles, giving presentations, and being a moderator on the [ASP.NET forums](/images/ "ASP.NET forums").

Grz, Kris.
