If you’re interested in data, analytics and artificial intelligence or just like to see Scott Guthrie talk you likely would like to join Microsoft on April 19th at [Data Amp – where data goes](/images/data-amp "Microsoft online event Data Amp").

Another event that might be of interest to you is the [Microsoft Data Insights Summit in June](/images/sessions "Data Insights Summit").

Grz, Kris.
