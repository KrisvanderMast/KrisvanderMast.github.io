Like Silverlight? Like search? Like them combined? If so be sure to check out the new [Tafiti search engine](/images/#p=0&q=Kris%20van%20der%20Mast "Tafiti search engine"). I especially liked the treeview option where you can see, in a rotating tree, what's been found. Probably it won't replace, for me anyway, [google](/images/www.google.com) or [live search](/images/search.live.com) but it shows the possibilities that you can obtain when using Silverlight. 
Speaking of which, if you're in Belgium on September 20th you can join the [VISUG meeting about Silverlight](/images/www.visug.be). I'll be there too.

Grz, Kris.
