Today, in the afternoon, I went to the first part, the next one's tomorrow, about [Visual Team System 2005](/images/NewsItemDetails.aspx?Id=e245ae0a-ea52-4e0d-9a8d-42b1cba8373b) an [event by VISUG](/images/NewsItemDetails.aspx?Id=e245ae0a-ea52-4e0d-9a8d-42b1cba8373b) of which I'm a member. Thanks to the people from Microsoft we also got a new book to read for free: Wrox' [Professional Visual Studio 2005 Team System](/images/productCd-0764584367.html).

The presentation is given by Steven Wilsens, whom is a Team System MVP and [will be joining Microsoft in a while](/images/MicrosoftTheUEFAChampionsLeagueAndMe.aspx).

I'm looking forward to the next part of the event.

Grz, Kris.
