In 2006 I put on my blog a diagram about the [ASP.NET Page Life Cycle](/images/PermaLink,guid,bbeb853d-16be-4db2-8917-3b2cf4cf42b8.aspx) which I found once on the internet, saved a copy of it but later on couldn’t find anywhere else.

It seems that Justin created a new diagram which you can **[download as a pdf document](/images/aspnet-lifecycle)**. Be sure to check it out.

Grz, Kris.
