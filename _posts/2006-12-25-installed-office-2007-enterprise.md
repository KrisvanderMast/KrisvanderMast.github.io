Yes, I finally installed Office 2007. It looks great and the new ribbon does need some "getting used to" but I'll manage. The only thing that drove me a bit crazy was that first it didn't want to install. Seemed that the installed conflicted with the installation of Expression Web Designer Beta. After uninstalling that everything went just fine. Pity though that the installer couldn't immediately tell me which program was causing the conflicts.

Anyway: Merry Christmas to all!!

Grz, Kris.
