I noticed that Visual Studio 2010 Beta 2 got out for MSDN subscribers today. It’ll be available for the rest of the world on October 23rd. Also good news: [next year on March 22 it’ll be there in RTW status](/images/announcing-visual-studio-2010-and-net-fx-4-beta-2.aspx).

Also the new version doesn’t use the standard logo with the 4 colors again but is now a smooth looking purple/blue logo.

Grz, Kris.
