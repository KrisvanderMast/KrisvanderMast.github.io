Just read [.NET Framework 3.0](/images/624300.aspx) at Somasegar's blog.

It's just rebranding of the name Microsoft pushed as WinFX, because behind the scenes it seems to be the same .NET 2.0 framework as we're having now, but with added value: Windows Presentation Foundation (/images/WPF), Windows Communication Foundation (/images/WCF), Windows Workflow Foundation (/images/WF) and Windows CardSpace (/images/WCS).

I'm already looking forward to .NET 4.0. Are you?

Update: another article by Brad Abrams is online too: [Toward .NET Framework 3.0...](/images/625717.aspx).

Grz, Kris.
