With prices of hard drives going up at the moment you might want to reclaim some valuable space on it.

Web Platform Installer is a great tool to streamline downloads, their dependencies and have these installed on computer. I’m sure you already have this gem installed. If not, then quickly reach out here and grab it: [http://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspx](/images/platform.aspx "http://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspx"). Really, do it now. It’s that cool.

Of course downloading all the cool new tools or updates can start to weigh on that poor little disk inside your pc after a while and you might want to clean up after a while. The steps are pretty easy if you know where to look:

1. Open **Windows Explorer**
2. In the address bar type in the following: **%localappdata%\Microsoft\Web Platform Installer**
3. In the Installers subfolder you can find the gold. Either save it on an external hard drive or delete as much as you want.

Grz, Kris.
