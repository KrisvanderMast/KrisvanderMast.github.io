Just noticed that [Visual studio 2010 and .NET framework 4.0 Beta 1 shipped](/images/visual-studio-2010-and-net-fx-4-beta-1-ships.aspx). This is great news as that means that people can download it and play around with but. More important though is that people can also provide feedback to Microsoft and make sure that unnoticed things might get kicked out before going RTW.

Also check out the [Product information page](/images/default.mspx).

Grz, Kris.
