*The most complicated aspect of large software projects is not the implementation, it is the real world domain that the software serves. Domain Driven Design is a vision and approach for dealing with highly complex domains that is based on making the domain itself the main focus of the project, and maintaining a software model that reflects a deep understanding of the domain.*

[Domain Driven Design Quickly](/images/domain-driven-design-quickly) *is a short, quick-readable summary and introduction to the fundamentals of DDD.*

Grz, Kris.
