I downloaded the documentation of the new [Silverlight 2 Beta 1](/images/Silverlight.chm). When I tried to open it, after a successful download was this:

[![chm_problem_01](/images/chm_problem_01_thumb_1.png)](/images/chm_problem_01_4.png)

Ok.... not really what I expected to see. After some asking around I found it [thanks to this post](/images/Why-my-CHM-file-does-not-work_3F00_.aspx). Apparently you have to open Windows Explorer and open the Properties window and push the Unblock button:

![chm_problem_02](/images/chm_problem_02_3.png)

And afterwards I was very happy to see this:

[![chm_problem_03](/images/chm_problem_03_thumb.png)](/images/chm_problem_03_2.png)

Happy reading for this guy and I hope for you the same.

Grz, Kris.
