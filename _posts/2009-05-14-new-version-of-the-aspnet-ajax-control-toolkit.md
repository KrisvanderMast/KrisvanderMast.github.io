Just saw on [Twitter](/images/www.twitter.com) that there’s a new version of the [ASP.NET AJAX Control toolkit](/images/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=27326) available on [codeplex](/images/www.codeplex.com). There are 3 new controls available:

* **HTMLEditor**: The HTMLEditor control allows you to easily create and edit HTML content. You can edit in design mode, as a rich text editor, or in source view to edit the HTML markup directly. [HTMLEditor demonstration](/images/HTMLEditor.aspx).
* **ComboBox**: The ComboBox control provides a DropDownList of items, combined with TextBox. Different modes determine the interplay between the text entry and the list of items. [ComboBox demonstration](/images/ComboBox.aspx).
* **ColorPicker**: The ColorPicker Control Extender can be attached to any ASP.NET TextBox control. It provides client-side color-picking functionality with UI in a popup control. [ColorPicker demonstration](/images/ColorPicker.aspx).

Be sure to also check out the [new videos](/images/#AjaxControlToolkit) dedicated for these controls and their [new tutorials](/images/#ajaxcontroltoolkit).

There’s also now a new tutorial available on [Creating a Custom AJAX Control Toolkit Control Extender](/images/tutorial-49-cs.aspx). Be sure to check it out.

Grz, Kris.
