It’s becoming a bit of a tradition in Belgium. No I’m not talking about the great beer or the weather this time but about [Community day](/images/www.communityday.be "Communiyt day"), again like last years a fest for community minded people like myself.

## The sessions

One of the important parts to gather a lot of people together is content and this year again there were lots of sessions to choose from. I took the following:

1. **Brewing beer with Windows Azure** (/images/Maarten Balliauw – Panagiotis Kefalidis): 
 
 A very nice session by 2 of my buddies and [AZUG](/images/ "AZUG") comrades. The first part was about a new hobby they’ve mastered: brewing beer. Then the session took a small turn and showed the new site running on Windows Azure Web Sites, integrating temperature probes via Service Bus and making use of ACS. A very interesting concept of what can be done with Azure and all the new stuff that shipped only a couple of weeks ago.
2. **Creating rich, responsive display and editor user interfaces with KnockoutJS** (/images/Tom Van Gaever): 
 
 [KnockoutJS](/images/www.knockoutjs.com "KnockoutJS") is that one very interesting MVVM javascript based framework. Both Tom and me were amazed to see that practically no one in the audience had tried, used or heard about it. It’s awesome! The session was taking a slowly paced introduction with small samples and building it up nicely for people who’ve never saw it.
3. **CQRS, only a buzzword or a suitable architecture for your problem domain?** (/images/Tim Mahy): 
 
 For me this was the best session of the day. It was well put up and brought a nice story and in the end showed why certain decisions in one of their projects was chosen, which the difficulties were and how they got around them. Very well brought session.
4. **Github for .NET developers** (/images/Bart Wullems – Kristof Mattei): 
 
 Most people make use of SVN or TFS but the new kid on the block is Git which increasing popularity. Both my [Ordina](/images/www.ordina.be "Ordina") colleagues brought an introduction session about Git via the command line, then going over making a repository on [Github](/images/www.github.co; "Github"). After showing everything with the command line tools just to get people to know where it all started with the new handy tool I like myself, Github for Windows, was made use off to show that most common Git tasks can now also be done with a graphical tool.
5. **Little productivity tools every professional developer should know about** (/images/Dennis Doomen): 
 
 A lot of this session was about OneNote. A cool tool from the Microsoft stables that I also like to make use off for personal reminders or quick jot downs. Dennis showed how they make use of it in an agile team, which conventions they make use off and how they share/work in such a way. Interesting approach. I didn’t see all of this session though as it was getting so extremely hot in the room that I wanted to go for some fresh air.
6. **NodeJS and Azure – what you need to know** (/images/Rob Ashton): 
 
 NodeJS is one of those technologies which are either already popular or becoming popular fast depending on the area in the world. Of course it’s also a first class citizen in Windows Azure and this session was all about it. A very short but interesting and entertaining session.

## The community

Aaaah, the community. The bunch of people who’re interested in learning more and keep up the motto: “Sharing is caring”. We love it! This year again there were a lot of people talking about technology, sharing ideas, talking about tech stuff, the new Microsoft Surface, Windows Phone 8, Windows Azure, … The community is strong in Belgium and it shows.

Also a bunch of MVPs and MEET members were present, even some from Holland and it was as usual a nice gather up and in the evening several of us had a very well tasting (/images/geek)dinner in the restaurant of the cinema complex where the entire Community day was held.

## The sponsors

Being a board member of AZUG myself I know all too well how important sponsors are for such events. This year there were again a lot of great sponsors and unlike other technical events there was a good interaction between the people before and after the stands. Most likely because no active recruitment was allowed and that gives more confidence of not getting harassed with uninteresting talks.

Likely one of the most appreciated sponsor initiatives was the [Combell](/images/www.combell.be "Combell") ice cream stand.

Conclusion:

This was a great day and well spent time to interact, learn, meet people, laugh, enjoy ice cream, … Up to the next one!

Grz, Kris.
