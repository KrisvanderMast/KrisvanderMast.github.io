Hi,

just found out about this sample application: [.NET StockTrader Sample Application](/images/bb499684.aspx).

*This application is an end-to-end sample application for .NET Enterprise Application Server technologies. It is a service-oriented application based on Windows* *Communication Foundation (/images/.NET 3.0) and ASP.NET, and illustrates many of the .NET enterprise development technologies for building highly scalable, rich "enterprise-connected" applications. It is designed as a benchmark kit to illustrate alternative technologies within .NET and their relative performance. The application offers full interoperability with J2EE and* [*IBM WebSphere's Trade 6.1*](/images/?linkid=6895278) *sample application. As such, the application offers an excellent opportunity for developers to learn about .NET and building interoperable, service-oriented applications.*

Since the weather in Belgium isn't that great at the moment I think I know what I'll be checking out the next week.

Grz, Kris.
