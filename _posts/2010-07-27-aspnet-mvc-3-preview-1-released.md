Today Microsoft released a new version of their MVC project. Still in preview but it looks promising, especially because the new view engine Razor got in it. Razor you say? That sounds familiar. And it should because it’s also a part which shipped with the [WebMatrix stack](/images/Webmatrix.aspx "WebMatrix"). This’ll make it easier for people starting with WebMatrix to get on track with MVC 3 as well.
