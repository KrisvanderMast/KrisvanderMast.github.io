From the Swiss MSDN blog:

*In this 108 page hands-on lab you will learn how to use Beta 2 of Visual Studio 2010 and Beta 1 of Microsoft Silverlight 4 to create a data driven line of business style rich internet application that implements many of the new features that Silverlight 4 introduces. We will base our solution on the Windows Communication Foundation (/images/WCF) RIA Servic*es.

*The solution will be an order-management system that shows a list of orders in a data grid and details of a selected order in a details pane. The system will validate user entries and have the capabilities of printing order reports and exporting order lists to Microsoft Excel.*

*[Download the hands-on lab manual in PDF and Word format, the database and the final sample solution.](/images/SL4-LOB-RIA-Lab.zip "Silverlight 4 and WCF RIA services Hand-on lab")*

* *True multi-tier architecture.*
* *Entity framework and service layer definition.*
* *Data filtering, paging, sorting and grouping.*
* *Data modification and validation.*
* *Foreign key management.*
* *Projections.*
* *Programmatic printing from a Silverlight application.*
* *COM interop with Microsoft Excel and running full-trust out-of-browser.*
