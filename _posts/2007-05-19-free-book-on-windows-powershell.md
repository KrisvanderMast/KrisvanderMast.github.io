I didn't had much time to play around with PowerShell myself but I noticed yesterday evening that [Gill](/images/English+Version+Of+Windows+PowerShell+Course+Book+Available.aspx) posted about a free eBook on the topic.

It's a [small download](/images/Windows%20Powershell%20-%20EN.zip) but is a nice to have if the technology interests you.

Grz, Kris.
