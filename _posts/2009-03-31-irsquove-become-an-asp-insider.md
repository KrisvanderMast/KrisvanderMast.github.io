I got the message from Microsoft that I’ve been added to the [ASP Insiders crew](/images/Insiders.aspx). This is a great reward from Microsoft towards certain people. Like Scott Guthrie described it:

*The ASPInsiders team spends countless hours answering questions and giving guidance to other ASP.NET developers, as well as providing feedback and direction on new features for future ASP.NET releases. Their work and contributions are invaluable.*

I’m very excited and honored by having this reward as it shows the recognition from Microsoft towards my continuous support towards members on the [ASP.NET forums](/images/forums.asp.net). The benefit for members are that I’m in more direct contact with the ASP.NET team itself being able to provide feedback and make suggestions about things I noticed either as a question on the forums or from personal experience. This can result in having Microsoft to create even better products for their customers.

Grz, Kris.
