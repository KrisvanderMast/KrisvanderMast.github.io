Well, yesterday’s Saturday was different from others. I got up at 5:30 and after breakfast, cleaning up and a shower I drove 120 km to Genk at the Microsoft Innovation Center to deliver a presentation for GWAB, also known as the **[Global Windows Azure Bootcamp](/images/ "Global Windows Azure Bootcamp")**.

The talk itself that I did was about a cool Microsoft technology: Visual Studio Online.

I had a blast and an attentive audience who loved to ask questions, mainly in person after the talk ![Smile](/images/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png).

The venue, MIC office Genk was set at the old mines over there. A beautiful place I for sure want to explore more in the future:

I was lucky that I could get the first slot as after I finished and answered questions I had to hurry to my second appointment 80-90 km further at the Jubelpark in Brussels to meet up with other Ingress players coming from Belgium, Netherlands, France, Germany and even Italy. All for the Recursion event that Google’s Niantic organized. We had great weather, I saw many people in real life for the first time or met up with Ingress buddies.

From the 3 clusters to conquer our faction, the Enlightened, only won 1 unfortunately. On the other hand we gave the other faction a good fight as they were with 150+ and we were more like 85. At the first cluster it was 4 against 12 so the team I was in was rather overwhelmed. The other 2 clusters we were the winning party. The nice team I was in was me and 3 people who came especially from Bonn Germany to play.

At the end of the day the Antwerp Ingress team gathered for a small restaurant after a great day of fun and then I decided to take the car back to Essen, another 100 km worth of driving ![Smile](/images/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png).

In case you’re wondering what Ingress is, take a look at the video that triggered my interest in November 2012: [http://www.ingress.com/](/images/ "http://www.ingress.com/")

Ah for the record: I walked more than 21000 steps.

Grz, Kris.
