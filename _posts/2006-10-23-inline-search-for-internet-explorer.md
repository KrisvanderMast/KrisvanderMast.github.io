[I installed IE7 last week](/images/IE7Released.aspx "IE7 released") and really enjoy it. This morning I took a look at the [on10](/images/ "On 10") site of Microsoft and [saw the video about addons for IE](/images/ "Enhance Internet Explorer with Add-ons from IEAddons.com"). I like the inline search capability of FireFox and when I saw there's an addon for IE available I immediately installed it. It's a bit of a shame that it isn't the default search functionality in IE but the addon does the work :-).

Taken from the website: *Inline Search is an extremely useful free add-on for Internet Explorer that mimics Firefox's search behavior, it turns searching into a Web page into a non modal research experience coupled with a search as you type facility. It integrates flawlessly into IE (/images/version 5.5 or above), giving it that little extra that makes you a lot more efficient when you are looking for a specific piece of information.*

[You can download the addon here](/images/AddOn.aspx?cid=2&scid=69&aid=329422de-a567-452b-b61d-a62fc54a0f7f "Inline Search for Internet Explorer").

Grz, Kris.
