If you’re busy with cloud architecture it’s always great if you can rely on proven practices. Microsoft releases on a regular basis guidelines and best practices. [In January this year Microsoft released such patterns for Cloud. The guide itself](/images/dn568099.aspx "Cloud Design Patterns"):

* Articulates the benefit of applying patterns when implementing cloud applications, especially when they will be hosted in Windows Azure.
* Discusses the problems that the patterns address, and how these relate to Windows Azure applications.
* Shows how to implement the patterns using the features of Windows Azure, emphasizing benefits and considerations.
* Depicts the big picture by showing how these patterns fit into cloud application architectures, and how they relate to other patterns.

There are also [code samples available for download](/images/details.aspx?id=41673 "Cloud Design Patterns code samples for download").

Specific areas handled are shown in the following diagram (/images/dn568099.aspx))
