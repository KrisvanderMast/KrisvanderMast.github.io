Since a couple of weeks I changed my IDE at work from Visual Studio 2005 to Visual Studio 2008 Team System for developers. We still target the .NET 2.0 framework but from what we found out, Intellisense in VB.NET has improved a lot. Since this morning I'm also using a new theme for Visual Studio since my collegue told me that he found it to be much better for his eyes. [Scott Hanselman wrote a while ago about different available themes](/images/VisualStudioProgrammerThemesGallery.aspx), and the one we took (/images/several of my collegues started to use recently) is [this one](/images/VisualStudioNet2005Colors.aspx). I'll be testing it for a while to see if it's indeed better for my eyes. 
 
Oh yes, it's always best to backup your current setting before trying out a new one. I wrote an article on how to do this in the past: [Exporting and importing Visual Studio 2005 settings](/images/ExportingAndImportingVisualStudio2005Settings.aspx). 
 
Grz, Kris.
