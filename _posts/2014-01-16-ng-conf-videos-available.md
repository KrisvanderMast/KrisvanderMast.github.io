[Angular.js](/images/angularjs.org), a powerful javascript based framework, is not only becoming increasingly more popular but now also has its own conference: ng-conf. If you, like myself, couldn’t go in person there’s nothing to worry about. The videos are being posted on Youtube. You can watch them here: [https://www.youtube.com/user/ngconfvideos?feature=watch](/images/ngconfvideos?feature=watch "https://www.youtube.com/user/ngconfvideos?feature=watch").

For .NET minded people there’s also an online effort being done at [http://henriquat.re/](/images/ "http://henriquat.re/").

Grz, Kris.
