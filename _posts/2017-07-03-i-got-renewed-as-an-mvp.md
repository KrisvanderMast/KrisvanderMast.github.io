I’m happy and honored to announce I got awarded as an Azure MVP for the coming year.

Since 2007 I made it as an ASP.NET MVP until last year where I became an Azure and Visual Studio Development and Technologies MVP. As I’ve been doing more and more in the Azure space it goes naturally that I didn’t make it in the VS Development and Technologies space this year. I’ll see if I can earn that one again next year back.

But the most important is the community stuff I’ve been involved in. It’s been an interesting year on that part, organizing quite many events in Belgium with azug, CloudBrew, going abroad to speak at conferences, …

Grz, Kris.
