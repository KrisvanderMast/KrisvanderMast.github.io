Just read the news on Scott Guthrie's blog that **[ASP.NET MVC RC](/images/asp-net-mvc-1-0-release-candidate-now-available.aspx)** got released today. That’s good news as this means that the final version will probably ship soon as well. Being a fan of jQuery since a couple of months, and already using it in production code, it’s great to see that it MVC ships with this great javascript library as well. Today still with version 1.2.6 but the 1.0 final release of MVC will have 1.3.1 included which is way more performing when you take a look at the **[graphs](/images/Release:jQuery_1.3)**.

Grz, Kris.
