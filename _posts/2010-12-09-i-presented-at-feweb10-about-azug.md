Since several months now I’m one of the board members of [Azug](/images/www.azug.be "Azug"), the Belgian Windows Azure User Group. [Feweb](/images/ "Feweb"), the Belgian organisation for web developers/designers, loved to put several Belgian user groups in the spotlight and asked them to give a short presentation about their workings, their common intrest, … Since I enjoy giving presentations I signed myself up and gave the following slidedeck:

If you’re from Belgium, or passing by in our lovely country, and we have a meeting planned then simply sign up and come over. We like you to be there!

Grz, Kris.
