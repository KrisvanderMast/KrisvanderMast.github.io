When I started my professional career in the magical .NET world on July 1st 2002, I joined the [ASP.NET forums](https://forums.asp.net) as a member. In the beginning lurking for information, asking questions. After a while I noticed I started to provide answers and I was amazed that they were helping people out solving their real world problems they faced. I kept on doing so and after a couple of years I was asked if I wanted to become a moderator and I did.  

During those years I've helped out countless people in my spare time and solved quite a lot of interesting puzzles (and gained more knowledge about ASP.NET myself at the same time) and I became the top spot holder in the [Hall of fame](https://www.asp.net/community/recognition/hall-of-fame).  

Today I went through the barrier of 190.000 recognition points thanks to all the contributions I've been doing during the past years. Now, up to the 200.000 mark.
