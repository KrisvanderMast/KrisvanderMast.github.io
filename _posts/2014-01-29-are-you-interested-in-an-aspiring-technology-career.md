If yes then by all means take a look at the following site: [Start your career in technology with Microsoft](/images/#fbid=A6pUf_YWj_f "http://borntolearn.mslearn.net/startyourcareer/#fbid=A6pUf_YWj_f"). It gives a starting point on where to begin a career in tech. Perhaps you might thing: uh oh that’s boring and it’s not for me, well think again. It’s a really exciting environment, it makes you think, work on real tools that helps to support the business of your company so that others can get their jobs done in a better, faster and more satisfying way. It for sure still gives me a good feeling whenever something I helped work on goes into production and people give (/images/positive) feedback on.

According to studies about 12.2% of the actively working population in Belgium, the country where I live, is in high tech environments and it’s only increasing. That’s a promising sector to be sure of a steady job and income to support your family. This morning I found out about an article in a Belgian newspaper that explains these numbers: [http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/942/Economie/article/detail/1783189/2014/01/29/Hightech-creeert-100-000-jobs.dhtml](/images/Hightech-creeert-100-000-jobs.dhtml "http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/942/Economie/article/detail/1783189/2014/01/29/Hightech-creeert-100-000-jobs.dhtml").

Grz, Kris.
