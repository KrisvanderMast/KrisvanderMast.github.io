I was browsing on the new pages for [ASP.NET MVC](/images/MVC) on [www.asp.net](/images/www.asp.net) and noticed that besides **Storefront** and **Nerddinner** there was another tutorial guide available: **Contact manager** by [Stephen Walther](/images/blog). It has currently already 7 tutorials:

* [Iteration #1 - Create the application](/images/tutorial-26-cs.aspx)
* [Iteration #2 - Make the application look nice](/images/tutorial-27-cs.aspx)
* [Iteration #3 - Add form validation](/images/tutorial-28-cs.aspx)
* [Iteration #4 - Make the application loosely coupled](/images/tutorial-29-cs.aspx)
* [Iteration #5 - Create unit tests](/images/tutorial-30-cs.aspx)
* [Iteration #6 - Use test driven development](/images/tutorial-31-cs.aspx)
* [Iteration #7 - Add Ajax functionality](/images/tutorial-32-cs.aspx)

Some more reading for me the next days…

Grz, Kris.
