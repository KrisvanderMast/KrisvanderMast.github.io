Today I found out about a [freely available online book about Coffeescript](/images/index.html "The Little Book on CoffeeScript").

If you don’t know what Coffeescript is all about then please take a look at this short introduction taken from [Wikipedia](/images/Coffeescript "Coffeescript on Wikipedia"):

“CoffeeScript is a programming language that transcompiles to JavaScript. The language adds syntactic sugar inspired by Ruby, Python and Haskell to enhance JavaScript's brevity and readability, as well as adding more sophisticated features like array comprehension and pattern matching. CoffeeScript compiles predictably to JavaScript and programs can be written with less code (/images/3 fewer lines) with no effect on runtime performance.”

Cool!

Of course besides being cool as a language, developers like to have cool editors to work with. One I found is the free [Mindscape Web Workbench](/images/2b96d16a-c986-4501-8f97-8008f9db141a "Mindscape Web Workbench").

If you’re more into learning from video tutorials you can check out the [Pluralsight training](/images/TableOfContents?courseName=coffeescript-fundamentals&highlight=liam-mclennan_04-working-with-coffeescript*2!liam-mclennan_03-installing-coffeescript!liam-mclennan_02-why-coffeescript!liam-mclennan_01-what-is-coffeescript*1!liam-mclennan_05-language-elements!liam-mclennan_06-data-types "Coffeescript training at Pluralsight") or [Tekpub one](/images/coffeescript "Tekpub Coffeescript session").

Grz, Kris.
