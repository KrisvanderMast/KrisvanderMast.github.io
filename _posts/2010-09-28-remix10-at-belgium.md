Today I went to Remix10 in Affligem. Due to some crazy traffic jams I missed a part of the keynote but was in time to see Katrien De Graeve jump in front of the new Kinect ![Smile](/images/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png).

The sessions which I followed were the one about IE9 beta, Sketchflow, putting an existing application into the cloud and the WebPI session. I mostly enjoyed the sessions about IE9/HTML5 and putting stuff in the cloud as these affect my day to day development endeavors the most. I already installed IE9 beta and like the new look & feel and the speed it runs with. For me that’s quite important as web applications are more and more becoming “heavyweight” ajaxised brower applications who call out from time to time to some service running on the server for updating data or extra retrieval. I just only can hope that Microsoft pushes it down to every pc running Windows (/images/7 put to rest).

During the pause I finally had the chance to play with the new Kinect and I must say, it was fun to do so. I’m already looking forward to another Remix event next year, and who knows, perhaps I might make it to the real one in Las Vegas (/images/would be great).

Grz, Kris.
