And this time I don't mean the song by [House of pain](/images/watch?v=ZZZADbubu0Y) (/images/upon which I also danced when I was way younger :-)).

I like the second video because it was filmed in Antwerp (/images/that's the province where I live) and because it's totally funny to see the reactions of some of the people in the crowd. The first video contains [LEGO](/images/www.lego.com). So it must be good :-).

Enjoy!

Grz, Kris.
