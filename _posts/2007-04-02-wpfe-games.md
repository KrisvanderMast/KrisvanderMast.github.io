Soon, at [MIX 07](/images/ "MIX 07"), WPF/e will be renamed as we were told last week by [Jeff Prosise at Dev Days Belgium](/images/DevAmpITProDayPreConferenceWithJeffProsise.aspx "Jeff Prosise Dev Days Belgium 2007"). Would be great because all too often people think it's the same as WPF, which it's not. WPF/e is a browser plugin, and Microsoft plans to have it available for different browsers and different OS'es. I've even heard/read somewhere that it'll also become available on mobile phones, pda's, ...

Why do I think that WPF/e, or the soon to be renamed version, will become a hit? GAMES! I got to know Flash several years ago, when it was still version 3, and I had to design a website for one of the parties I and a couple of friends organised (/images/back in 1998). It became silently more and more popular, especially when it wasn't only timelines and stuff anymore but became a rich environment a developer could program with Actionscript. Especially games made it popular. Heck, even my mother likes to play those flash games online.

Ok, enough babbling from my side, [get the plugin](/images/details.aspx?FamilyId=E63992D3-CCF5-40B9-B98A-D16BCA57467C&displaylang=en "WPF/e plugin february CTP"), and get gaming:

* [Magnet game](/images/magnetgame "Magnet game")* [Sprawl game](/images/default.html "Sprawl game")

Grz, Kris.
