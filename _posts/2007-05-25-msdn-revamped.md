In case you didn't notice it, the MSDN site got revamped. Actually I like the new look & feel. If you're tired of seeing the treeview on the left you can just press the "**T**" key to make it hiding itself.

When you hover over the parts in the breadcrumb that also shows a nice dropdown to which you can easily link to other parts. I like it!

Grz, Kris.
