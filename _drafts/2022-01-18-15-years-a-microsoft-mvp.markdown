Today I received a nice token of appreciation by Microsoft. My disk of being a Microsoft MVP for 15 years!  

All thanks to the continued support I was able to provide to the vast community over all those years. Writing answers on forums.asp.net or stackoverflow, giving presentations, organising AZUG sessions, organising CloudBrew conferences, helping out people who ask for help, coaching a Phd student (in ai and teaching to write better Python code), ...

It's been quite a ride so far and I will continue to do so for hopefully many years to come.
