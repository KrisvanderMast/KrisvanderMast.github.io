Hi, I'm Kris van der Mast! Thank you for wanting to hire me!

As a freelance consultant, I provide software development, consultancy, training, coaching and mentoring services to other companies. [Learn more about me](/about-me.html) or [have a look at my public CV](http://stackoverflow.com/cv/krisvandermast), and [contact me](/contact-me.html) if you want more info or want to have a chat.

<p class="notice--success">
  Have you ever faced a blocking issue and quickly needed advice from an expert in the field? Have an important question but don't want to hire a consultant to come on-site for a full day? You periodically need some external advice on your project? <em>We can set up a remote meeting for one or more hours and analyze the issue right away!<b><a href="/contact-me.html">Get in touch!</a></b></em>
</p>

My focus is on:

* .NET ecosystem, C#, ASP.NET MVC
* Cloud (Microsoft Azure, ...)
* Chatbots
* Solution architecture
* Debugging, performance profiling, memory profiling
* General software development practices (think continuous integration, continuous deployment, dependency management, ...)
* Mentoring / coaching / training on any of the above topics
* Learning from others

I like to work remotely if possible, but can always come to your office(s) as well - whether in Belgium, Europe, or the world. Take a look at my [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/krisvandermast) profile for more background on what I already did so far and what my line of expertise is.

[Contact me](/contact-me.html) for more info.
