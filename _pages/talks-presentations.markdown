This page contains links and short information on the talks that I have (co-)presented. If available, a link to slides and recording is also provided.

Attended a talk and looking for demo material or thought of a question? Don't hesitate and ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/maartenballiauw) or [reach out via another channel](/about-me.html).

## Upcoming talks

* Basta! - Germany

If you want me to deliver a talk at your user group or conference, feel free to [reach out](/about-me.html). I'll be happy to provide you with session proposals.
